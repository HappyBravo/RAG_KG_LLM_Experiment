      "{'title': 'Wedding', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding', 'summary': 'A wedding is a ceremony where two people are united in marriage. Wedding traditions and customs vary greatly between cultures, ethnic groups, races, religions, denominations, countries, social classes, and sexual orientations. Most wedding ceremonies involve an exchange of marriage vows by a couple, presentation of a gift (offering, rings, symbolic item, flowers, money, dress), and a public proclamation of marriage by an authority figure or celebrant. Special wedding garments are often worn, and the ceremony is sometimes followed by a wedding reception. Music, poetry, prayers, or readings from religious texts or literature are also commonly incorporated into the ceremony, as well as superstitious customs.\\n==Common elements across cultures==\\nSome cultures have adopted the traditional Western custom of the white wedding, in which a bride wears a white wedding dress and veil. This tradition was popularized through the marriage of Queen Victoria. Some say Queen Victoria\\'s choice of a white gown may have simply been a sign of extravagance, but may have also been influenced by the values she held which emphasized sexual purity.\\nThe use of a wedding ring has long been part of religious weddings in Europe and America, but the origin of the tradition is unclear. One possibility is the Roman belief in the Vena amoris, which was believed to be a blood vessel that ran from the fourth finger (ring finger) directly to the heart. Thus, when a couple wore rings on this finger, their hearts were connected. Historian Vicki Howard points out that the belief in the \"ancient\" quality of the practice is most likely a modern invention. In the United States of America, a groom\\'s wedding band has not appeared until the early 20th century, while in Europe it has been part of the tradition since the ancient Romans, as witnessed by the jurist Gaius.\\nThe exit from the wedding ceremony is also called the \"send off\", and often includes traditional practices, such as the newlyweds and the wedding party bowing and kissing the knees of the elders in Ethiopian weddings. The send off often includes throwing rice (a symbol of prosperity and fertility) or other seeds at the newlyweds in most of the Western world, as well as for example India and Malaysia. Despite fears of the opposite, the use of uncooked rice for this purpose is not harmful to birds. Shoe tossing in place of rice has also been used in several cultures.\\nThe wedding ceremony is often followed by wedding reception or a wedding breakfast, in which the rituals may include speeches from a groom, best man, father of a bride and possibly a bride, the newlyweds\\''}\n",
      "{'title': 'White House', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House', 'summary': 'The White House is the official residence and workplace of the president of the United States. It is located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C., and has been the residence of every U.S. president since John Adams in 1800 when the national capital was moved from Philadelphia. The term \"White House\" is often used as metonymy for the president and his advisers.\\nThe residence was designed by Irish-born architect James Hoban in the Neoclassical style. Hoban modeled the building on Leinster House in Dublin, a building which today houses the Oireachtas, the Irish legislature. Construction took place between 1792 and 1800, with an exterior of Aquia Creek sandstone painted white. When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801, he and architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe added low colonnades on each wing to conceal what then were stables and storage. In 1814, during the War of 1812, the mansion was set ablaze by British forces in the burning of Washington, destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior. Reconstruction began almost immediately, and President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed Executive Residence in October 1817. Exterior construction continued with the addition of the semicircular South Portico in 1824 and the North Portico in 1829.\\nBecause of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901. Eight years later, in 1909, President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office, which was eventually moved and expanded. In the Executive Residence, the third floor attic was converted to living quarters in 1927 by augmenting the existing [roof] with long shed dormers. A newly constructed East Wing was used as a reception area for social events; Jefferson\\'s colonnades connected the new wings. The East Wing alterations were completed in 1946, creating additional office space. By 1948, the residence\\'s load-bearing walls and wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under Harry S. Truman, the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal load-bearing steel frame was constructed inside the walls. On the exterior, the Truman Balcony was added. Once the structural work was completed, the interior rooms were rebuilt.\\nThe present-day White House complex includes the Executive Residence, the West Wing, the East Wing, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which previously served the State Department and other departments (it now houses additional offices for the president\\'s staff and the vice president), and Blair House, a guest residence. The Executive Residence is made up of six stories: the Ground Floor, State Floor, Second Floor, and Third Floor, and a two-story basement. The property is a National Heritage Site owned by the National Park Service and is part of the President\\'s Park. In 2007, it was ranked second on the American Institute of Architects list of America\\'s Favorite Architecture.\\n==Early history==\\n===1789–1800===\\nFollowing his April 1789 inauguration, President George Washington occupied two private houses in New York City, which served as the executive mansion. He lived at the first, Franklin House, which was owned by Treasury Commissioner Samuel Osgood, at 3Cherry Street, through late February 1790.  The executive mansion moved to the larger quarters at Alexander Macomb House at 39–41 Broadway,, where Washington stayed with his wife Martha and a small staff until August 1790. In May 1790, construction began on a new official residence in Manhattan called Government House. \\nWashington never lived at Government House since the national capital was moved to Philadelphia in 1790, where it remained through 1800. The July 1790 Residence Act designated the capital be permanently located in the new Federal District, and temporarily in Philadelphia for ten years while the permanent capital was built. Philadelphia rented the mansion of Robert Morris, a merchant, at 190 High Street, now 524–30 Market Street, as the President\\'s House, which Washington occupied from November 1790 to March 1797.  Since the house was too small to accommodate the 30 people who then made up the presidential family, staff, and servants, Washington had it enlarged.\\nPresident John Adams, who succeeded Washington and served as the nation\\'s second president, occupied the High Street mansion in Philadelphia from March 1797 to May 1800. Philadelphia began construction of a much grander presidential mansion several blocks away in 1792. It was nearly completed by the time of Adams\\' 1797 inauguration. However, Adams chose not to occupy it, saying he did not have Congressional authorization to lease the building. It remained vacant until 1800 when it was sold to the University of Pennsylvania.  \\nOn Saturday, November 1, 1800, Adams became the first president to occupy the White House. The President\\'s House in Philadelphia was converted into Union Hotel and later used for stores before being demolished in 1832.\\n===Architectural competition===\\nThe President\\'s House was a major feature of Pierre (Peter) Charles L\\'Enfant\\'s 1791 plan for the newly established federal city of Washington, D.C. Washington and his Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, who both had personal interests in architecture, agreed that the design of the White House and the Capitol would be chosen in a design competition.\\nNine proposals were submitted for the new presidential residence with the award going to Irish-American architect James Hoban. Hoban supervised the construction of both the U.S. Capitol and the White House. Hoban was born in Ireland and trained at the Dublin Society of Arts. He emigrated to the U.S. after the American Revolution, first seeking work in Philadelphia and later finding success in South Carolina, where he designed the state capitol in Columbia. \\nPresident Washington visited Charleston, South Carolina, in May 1791 on his Southern Tour, and saw the Charleston County Courthouse then under construction, which had been designed by Hoban. Washington is reputed to have met with Hoban during the visit. The following year, Washington summoned the architect to Philadelphia and met with him in June 1792.\\nOn July 16, 1792, the president met with the commissioners of the federal city to make his judgment in the architectural competition. His review is recorded as being brief, and he quickly selected Hoban\\'s submission.\\n===Design influences===\\nThe Neoclassical design of the White House is based primarily on architectural concepts inherited from the Roman architect Vitruvius and the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio. The design of the upper floors also includes elements based on Dublin\\'s Leinster House, which later became the seat of the Irish parliament (Oireachtas). The upper windows with alternate triangular and segmented pediments are inspired by the Irish building. Additionally, several Georgian-era Irish country houses have been suggested as sources of inspiration for the overall floor plan, including the bow-fronted south front and the former niches in the present-day Blue Room.\\nThe first official White House guide, published in 1962, suggested a link between Hoban\\'s design for the South Portico and Château de Rastignac, a neoclassical country house in La Bachellerie in the Dordogne region of France. Construction on the French house was initially started before 1789, interrupted by the French Revolution for 20 years, and then finally built between 1812 and 1817 based on Salat\\'s pre-1789 design. \\nThe conceptual link between the two houses has been criticized because Hoban did not visit France. Supporters of the connection contend that Thomas Jefferson, during his tour of Bordeaux in 1789, viewed Salat\\'s architectural drawings, which were on file at École Spéciale d\\'Architecture.  On his return to the U.S., Jefferson then shared the influence with Washington, Hoban, Monroe, and Benjamin Henry Latrobe.\\n===Construction===\\nConstruction of the White House began at noon on October 13, 1792, with the laying of the cornerstone. The main residence and foundations of the house were built largely by both enslaved and free African-American laborers, and employed Europeans. Much of the other work on the house was done by immigrants, many of whom had not yet obtained citizenship, including the sandstone walls, which were erected by Scottish immigrants, the high-relief rose, and garland decorations above the north entrance and the fish scale pattern beneath the pediments of the window hoods. \\nThere are conflicting claims as to where the sandstone used in the construction of the White House originated. Some reports suggest sandstone from the Croatian island of Brač, specifically the Pučišća quarry whose stone was used to build the ancient Diocletian\\'s Palace in Split, was used in the building\\'s original construction. However, researchers believe limestone from the island was used in the 1902 renovations and not the original construction. Others suggest the original sandstone simply came from Aquia Creek in Stafford County, Virginia, since importation of the stone at the time would have proved too costly. The initial construction took place over a period of eight years at a reported cost of $232,371.83 (). Although not yet completed, the White House was ready for occupancy circa November 1, 1800.\\nDue in part to material and labor shortages, Pierre Charles L\\'Enfant\\'s plan for a grand palace was five times larger than the house that was eventually built. The finished structure contained only two main floors instead of the planned three, and a less costly brick served as a lining for the stone façades. When construction was finished, the porous sandstone walls were whitewashed with a mixture of lime, rice glue, casein, and lead, giving the house its familiar color and name.\\n===Architectural description===\\nThe main entrance is located on the north façade under a porte cochere with Ionic columns. The ground floor is hidden by a raised carriage ramp and parapet. The central three bays are situated behind a prostyle portico that was added . The windows of the four bays flanking the portico, at first-floor level, have alternating pointed and segmented pediments, while the second-floor pediments are flat. A lunette fanlight and a sculpted floral festoon surmount the entrance. The roofline is hidden by a balustraded parapet.\\nThe three-level southern façade combines Palladian and neoclassical architectural styles. The ground floor is rusticated in the Palladian fashion. The south portico was completed in 1824. At the center of the southern façade is a neoclassical projected bow of three bays. The bow is flanked by five bays, the windows of which, as on the north façade, have alternating segmented and pointed pediments at first-floor level. The bow has a ground-floor double staircase leading to an Ionic colonnaded loggia and the Truman Balcony, built in 1946.  The more modern third floor is hidden by a balustraded parapet and plays no part in the composition of the façade.\\n===Naming conventions===\\nThe building was originally variously referred to as the President\\'s Palace, Presidential Mansion, or President\\'s House. The earliest evidence of the public calling it the \"White House\" was recorded in 1811. A myth emerged that during the rebuilding of the structure after the Burning of Washington, white paint was applied to mask the burn damage it had suffered, giving the building its namesake hue. The name \"Executive Mansion\" was used in official contexts until President Theodore Roosevelt established \"The White House\" as its formal name in 1901 via Executive Order. The current letterhead wording and arrangement of \"The White House\" with the word \"Washington\" centered beneath it dates to the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\\nAlthough the structure was not completed until some years after the presidency of George Washington, there is speculation that the name of the traditional residence of the president of the United States may have been derived from Martha Washington\\'s home, White House Plantation, in Virginia, where the nation\\'s first president courted the first lady in the mid-18th century.\\n==Evolution of the White House==\\n===Early use, 1814 burning, and reconstruction===\\nOn Saturday, November 1, 1800, John Adams became the first president to take residence in the building. The next day he wrote his wife Abigail:\\n\"I pray Heaven to bestow the best of blessings on this House, and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof.\" \\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt had Adams\\'s blessing carved into the mantel in the State Dining Room.\\nAdams lived in the house only briefly before Thomas Jefferson moved into the \"pleasant country residence\" in 1801. Despite his complaints that the house was too big (\"big enough for two emperors, one pope, and the grand lama in the bargain\"), Jefferson considered how the White House might be added to. With Benjamin Henry Latrobe, he helped lay out the design for the East and West Colonnades, small wings that help conceal the domestic operations of laundry, a stable and storage. Today, Jefferson\\'s colonnades link the residence with the East and West Wings.\\nIn 1814, during the War of 1812, the White House was burnt by British forces during the Burning of Washington, in retaliation for acts of destruction by American troops in the Canadas; much of Washington was affected by these fires as well. Only the exterior walls remained, and they had to be torn down and mostly reconstructed because of weakening from the fire and subsequent exposure to the elements, except for portions of the south wall. Of the numerous objects taken from the White House when it was sacked by the British, only three have been recovered.\\nWhite House employees and slaves rescued a copy of the Lansdowne portrait, and in 1939 a Canadian man returned a jewelry box to President Franklin Roosevelt, claiming that his grandfather had taken it from Washington; in the same year, a medicine chest that had belonged to President Madison was returned by the descendants of a Royal Navy officer. Some observers allege that most of the spoils of war taken during the sack were lost when a convoy of British ships led by HMS Fantome sank en route to Halifax off Prospect during a storm on the night of November 24, 1814, even though Fantome had no involvement in that action.\\nAfter the fire, President James Madison resided in the Octagon House from 1814 to 1815, and then in the Seven Buildings from 1815 to the end of his term. Meanwhile, both Hoban and Latrobe contributed to the design and oversight of the reconstruction, which lasted from 1815 until 1817. The south portico was constructed in 1824 during the James Monroe administration. The north portico was built in 1830. Though Latrobe proposed similar porticos before the fire in 1814, both porticos were built as designed by Hoban. An elliptical portico at Château de Rastignac in La Bachellerie, France, with nearly identical curved stairs, is speculated as the source of inspiration due to its similarity with the South Portico, although this matter is one of great debate. \\nItalian artisans, brought to Washington to help in constructing the U.S. Capitol, carved the decorative stonework on both porticos. Contrary to speculation, the North Portico was not modeled on a similar portico on another Dublin building, the Viceregal Lodge (now Áras an Uachtaráin, residence of the president of Ireland), for its portico postdates the White House porticos\\' design. For the North Portico, a variation on the Ionic Order was devised, incorporating a swag of roses between the volutes. This was done to link the new portico with the earlier carved roses above the entrance.\\n===Overcrowding and building the West Wing===\\nBy the time of the American Civil War, the White House had become overcrowded. The location of the White House, just north of a canal and swampy lands, which provided conditions ripe for malaria and other unhealthy conditions, was questioned. Brigadier General Nathaniel Michler was tasked with proposing solutions to address these concerns. He proposed abandoning the use of the White House as a residence, and he designed a new estate for the first family at Meridian Hill in Washington, D.C. Congress, however, rejected the plan. Another option was Metropolis View, which is now the campus of The Catholic University of America.\\nWhen Chester A. Arthur took office in 1881, he ordered renovations to the White House to take place as soon as the recently widowed Lucretia Garfield moved out. Arthur inspected the work almost nightly and made several suggestions. Louis Comfort Tiffany was asked to send selected designers to assist. Over twenty wagonloads of furniture and household items were removed from the building and sold at a public auction. All that was saved were bust portraits of John Adams and Martin Van Buren. A proposal was made to build a new residence south of the White House, but it failed to gain support.\\nIn the fall of 1882, work was done on the main corridor, including tinting the walls pale olive and adding squares of gold leaf, and decorating the ceiling in gold and silver, with colorful traceries woven to spell \"USA.\" The Red Room was painted a dull Pomeranian red, and its ceiling was decorated with gold, silver, and copper stars and stripes of red, white, and blue. A fifty-foot jeweled Tiffany glass screen, supported by imitation marble columns, replaced the glass doors that separated the main corridor from the north vestibule.\\nIn 1891, First Lady Caroline Harrison proposed major extensions to the White House, including a National Wing on the east for a historical art gallery, and a wing on the west for official functions. A plan was devised by Colonel Theodore A. Bingham that reflected the Harrison proposal. These plans were ultimately rejected.\\nIn 1902, however, Theodore Roosevelt hired McKim, Mead & White to carry out expansions and renovations in a neoclassical style suited to the building\\'s architecture, removing the Tiffany screen and all Victorian additions. Charles McKim himself designed and managed the project, which gave more living space to the president\\'s large family by removing a staircase in the West Hall and moving executive office staff from the second floor of the residence into the new West Wing.\\nPresident William Howard Taft enlisted the help of architect Nathan C. Wyeth to add additional space to the West Wing, which included the addition of the Oval Office. In 1925, Congress enacted legislation allowing the White House to accept gifts of furniture and art for the first time. The West Wing was damaged by fire on Christmas Eve 1929; Herbert Hoover and his aides moved back into it on April 14, 1930. In the 1930s, a second story was added, as well as a larger basement for White House staff, and President Franklin Roosevelt had the Oval Office moved to its present location: adjacent to the Rose Garden.\\n===Truman reconstruction===\\nDecades of poor maintenance, the construction of a fourth-story attic during the Coolidge administration, and the addition of a second-floor balcony over the south portico for Harry S. Truman took a great toll on the brick and sandstone structure built around a timber frame. By 1948, the house was declared to be in imminent danger of collapse, forcing President Truman to commission a reconstruction and to live across the street at Blair House from 1949 to 1951. \\nThe work, completed by the firm of Philadelphia contractor John McShain, required the complete dismantling of the interior spaces, construction of a new load-bearing internal steel frame, and the reconstruction of the original rooms within the new structure. The total cost of the renovations was about $5.7million ($ million in ). Some modifications to the floor plan were made, the largest being the repositioning of the grand staircase to open into the Entrance Hall, rather than the Cross Hall. Central air conditioning was added, as well as two additional sub-basements providing space for workrooms, storage, and a bomb shelter. The Trumans moved back into the White House on March 27, 1952. \\nWhile the Truman reconstruction preserved the house\\'s structure, much of the new interior finishes were generic and of little historic significance. Much of the original plasterwork, some dating back to the 1814–1816 rebuilding, was too damaged to reinstall, as was the original robust Beaux Arts paneling in the East Room. President Truman had the original timber frame sawed into paneling; the walls of the Vermeil Room, Library, China Room, and Map Room on the ground floor of the main residence were paneled in wood from the timbers.\\n===Jacqueline Kennedy restoration===\\nJacqueline Kennedy, wife of President John F. Kennedy (1961–63), directed a very extensive and historic redecoration of the house. She enlisted the help of Henry Francis du Pont of the Winterthur Museum to assist in collecting artifacts for the mansion, many of which had once been housed there. Other antiques, fine paintings, and improvements from the Kennedy period were donated to the White House by wealthy philanthropists, including the Crowninshield family, Jane Engelhard, Jayne Wrightsman, and the Oppenheimer family.\\nStéphane Boudin of the House of Jansen, a Paris interior-design firm that had been recognized worldwide, was employed by Jacqueline Kennedy to assist with the decoration. Different periods of the early republic and world history were selected as a theme for each room: the Federal style for the Green Room, French Empire for the Blue Room, American Empire for the Red Room, Louis XVI for the Yellow Oval Room, and Victorian for the president\\'s study, renamed the Treaty Room. Antique furniture was acquired, and decorative fabric and trim based on period documents was produced and installed.\\nThe Kennedy restoration resulted in a more authentic White House of grander stature, which recalled the French taste of Madison and Monroe. In the Diplomatic Reception Room, Mrs. Kennedy installed an antique \"Vue de l\\'Amérique Nord\" wallpaper which Zuber & Cie had designed in 1834. The wallpaper had hung previously on the walls of another mansion until 1961 when that house was demolished for a grocery store. Just before the demolition, the wallpaper was salvaged and sold to the White House.\\nThe first White House guidebook was produced under the direction of curator Lorraine Waxman Pearce with direct supervision from Mrs. Kennedy. Sales of the guidebook helped finance the restoration.\\nIn a televised tour of the house on Valentine\\'s Day in 1962, Kennedy showed her restoration of the White House to the public.\\n==The White House since the Kennedy restoration==\\nCongress enacted legislation in September 1961 declaring the White House a museum. Furniture, fixtures, and decorative arts could now be declared either historic or of artistic interest by the president. This prevented them from being sold (as many objects in the executive mansion had been in the past 150 years). When not in use or display at the White House, these items were to be turned over to the Smithsonian Institution for preservation, study, storage, or exhibition. The White House retains the right to have these items returned.\\nOut of respect for the historic character of the White House, no substantive architectural changes have been made to the house since the Truman renovation. Since the Kennedy restoration, every presidential family has made some changes to the private quarters of the White House, but the Committee for the Preservation of the White House must approve any modifications to the State Rooms. Charged with maintaining the historical integrity of the White House, the congressionally authorized committee works with each First Familyusually represented by the first lady, the White House curator, and the chief usherto implement the family\\'s proposals for altering the house.\\nDuring the Nixon Administration (1969–1974), First Lady Pat Nixon refurbished the Green Room, Blue Room, and Red Room, working with Clement Conger, the curator appointed by President Richard Nixon. Mrs. Nixon\\'s efforts brought more than 600 artifacts to the house, the largest acquisition by any administration. Her husband created the modern press briefing room over Franklin Roosevelt\\'s old swimming pool. Nixon also added a single-lane bowling alley to the White House basement.\\nComputers and the first laser printer were added during the Carter administration, and the use of computer technology was expanded during the Reagan administration. A Carter-era innovation, a set of solar water heating panels that were mounted on the roof of the White House, was removed during Reagan\\'s presidency. Redecorations were made to the private family quarters and maintenance was made to public areas during the Reagan years. The house was accredited as a museum in 1988.\\nIn the 1990s, Bill and Hillary Clinton refurbished some rooms with the assistance of Arkansas decorator Kaki Hockersmith, including the Oval Office, the East Room, Blue Room, State Dining Room, Lincoln Bedroom, and Lincoln Sitting Room. During the administration of George W. Bush, First Lady Laura Bush refurbished the Lincoln Bedroom in a style contemporary with the Lincoln era; the Green Room, Cabinet Room, and theater were also refurbished.\\nThe White House became one of the first wheelchair-accessible government buildings in Washington, D.C. when modifications were made during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who used a wheelchair because of his paralytic illness. In the 1990s, Hillary Clinton, at the suggestion of the Visitors Office director, approved the addition of a ramp in the East Wing corridor, affording easier wheelchair access for the public tours and special events that enter through the secure entrance building on the east side.\\nIn 2003, the Bush administration reinstalled solar thermal heaters. These units are used to heat water for landscape maintenance personnel and for the presidential pool and spa. One hundred sixty-seven solar photovoltaic grid-tied panels were installed at the same time on the roof of the maintenance facility. The changes were not publicized as a White House spokeswoman said the changes were an internal matter, but the story was covered by industry trade journals. In 2013, President Barack Obama had a set of solar panels installed on the roof of the White House, making it the first time solar power was used for the president\\'s living quarters.\\n===Layout and amenities===\\nThe current group of buildings housing the presidency is known as the White House Complex. It includes the central Executive Residence flanked by the East Wing and West Wing. The chief usher coordinates day to day household operations. The White House includes six stories and 55,000 square feet (5,100 m2) of floor space, 132 rooms and 35 bathrooms, 412 doors, 147 windows, 28 fireplaces, eight staircases, three elevators, five full-time chefs, a tennis court, a (single-lane) bowling alley, a movie theater (officially called the White House Family Theater), a jogging track, a swimming pool, and a putting green. It receives up to 30,000 visitors each week.\\n===Executive Residence===\\nThe original residence is in the center. Two colonnadesone on the east and one on the westdesigned by Jefferson, now serve to connect the East and West Wings added later. The Executive Residence houses the president\\'s dwelling, as well as rooms for ceremonies and official entertaining. The State Floor of the residence building includes the East Room, Green Room, Blue Room, Red Room, State Dining Room, Family Dining Room, Cross Hall, Entrance Hall, and Grand Staircase. The Ground Floor is made up of the Diplomatic Reception Room, Map Room, China Room, Vermeil Room, Library, the main kitchen, and other offices. \\nThe second floor family residence includes the Yellow Oval Room, East and West Sitting Halls, the White House Master Bedroom, President\\'s Dining Room, the Treaty Room, Lincoln Bedroom and Queens\\' Bedroom, as well as two additional bedrooms, a smaller kitchen, and a private dressing room. The third floor consists of the White House Solarium, Game Room, Linen Room, a Diet Kitchen, and another sitting room (previously used as President George W. Bush\\'s workout room).\\n===West Wing===\\nThe West Wing houses the president\\'s office (the Oval Office) and offices of his senior staff, with room for about 50 employees. It includes the Cabinet Room, where the president conducts business meetings and where the Cabinet meets, as well as the White House Situation Room, James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, and the Roosevelt Room. In 2007, work was completed on renovations of the press briefing room, adding fiber optic cables and LCD screens for the display of charts and graphs. The makeover took 11 months and cost of $8million, of which news outlets paid $2million. In September 2010, a two-year project began on the West Wing, creating a multistory underground structure.\\nSome members of the president\\'s staff are located in the adjacent Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which was, until 1999, called the Old Executive Office Building and was historically the State War and Navy building.\\nThe Oval Office, Roosevelt Room, and other portions of the West Wing were partially replicated on a sound stage and used as the setting for The West Wing television show.\\n===East Wing===\\nThe East Wing, which contains additional office space, was added to the White House in 1942. Among its uses, the East Wing has intermittently housed the offices and staff of the first lady and the White House Social Office. Rosalynn Carter, in 1977, was the first to place her personal office in the East Wing and to formally call it the \"Office of the First Lady\". The East Wing was built during World War II in order to hide the construction of an underground bunker to be used in emergencies. The bunker has come to be known as the Presidential Emergency Operations Center.\\n===Grounds===\\nThe White House and grounds cover just over 18 acres (about 7.3 hectares). Before the construction of the North Portico, most public events were entered from the South Lawn, the grading and planting of which was ordered by Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson also drafted a planting plan for the North Lawn that included large trees that would have mostly obscured the house from Pennsylvania Avenue. During the mid-to-late 19th century a series of ever larger greenhouses were built on the west side of the house, where the current West Wing is located. During this period, the North Lawn was planted with ornate carpet-style flowerbeds. \\nThe general layout of the White House grounds today is based on the 1935 design by Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. of the Olmsted Brothers firm, commissioned by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During the Kennedy administration, the White House Rose Garden was redesigned by Rachel Lambert Mellon. The Rose Garden borders the West Colonnade. Bordering the East Colonnade is the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, which was begun by Jacqueline Kennedy but completed after her husband\\'s assassination. \\nOn the weekend of June 23, 2006, a century-old American Elm (Ulmus americana L.) tree on the north side of the building came down during one of the many storms amid intense flooding. Among the oldest trees on the grounds are several magnolias (Magnolia grandiflora) planted by Andrew Jackson, including the Jackson Magnolia, reportedly grown from a sprout taken from the favorite tree of Jackson\\'s recently deceased wife, the sprout planted after Jackson moved into the White House. The tree stood for over 200 years. In 2017, having become too weak to stand on its own, it was decided it should be removed and replaced with one of its offspring. \\nMichelle Obama planted the White House\\'s first organic garden and installed beehives on the South Lawn of the White House, which will supply organic produce and honey to the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings. In 2020, First Lady Melania Trump redesigned the Rose Garden.\\n==Public access and security==\\n===Historical accessibility===\\nLike the English and Irish country houses it was modeled on, the White House was, from the start, open to the public until the early part of the 20th century. President Thomas Jefferson held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many of the people at his swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol followed him home, where he greeted them in the Blue Room. Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President Andrew Jackson had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the White House. His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey. \\nThe practice continued until 1885, when newly elected Grover Cleveland arranged for a presidential review of the troops from a grandstand in front of the White House instead of the traditional open house. Inspired by Washington\\'s open houses in New York and Philadelphia, John Adams began the tradition of the White House New Year\\'s Reception. Jefferson permitted public tours of his house, which have continued ever since, except during wartime, and began the tradition of an annual reception on the Fourth of July. Those receptions ended in the early 1930s. President Bill Clinton briefly revived the New Year\\'s Day open house in his first term.\\n===Aviation incidents===\\nIn February 1974, a stolen U.S. Army helicopter landed without authorization on the White House\\'s grounds. Twenty years later, in 1994, a stolen light plane flown by Frank Eugene Corder crashed on White House grounds, causing Corder to die instantly.\\nDuring the September 11 attacks, shortly after notice of the plane impacts, the White House staff and other occupants were ordered to evacuate by the U.S. Secret Service after a call was made to them from Ronald Reagan National Airport air traffic control staff, stating, \"There is an aircraft coming at you,\" though an aircraft never did show up.\\nOn May 12, 2005, as a result of increased security regarding air traffic in the capital, the White House was evacuated after an unauthorized aircraft could approach the grounds. After being forced to land by two F-16 fighter jets and a Black Hawk helicopter at a small airport nearby, the pilot was identified to be a student pilot who accidentally breached White House grounds without knowledge.\\nOn January 27, 2015, at 3 a.m. an intoxicated man flew a quadcopter drone from his apartment near the White House but lost control of it, prompting it to crash on the southeast side on White House grounds. The White House was temporarily put on lockdown by the Secret Service shortly after an officer reported witnessing \"[a] drone flying at a low altitude.\" Investigators suspected that the drone accidentally flew and breached into the property because of either wind or trees.\\nIn June 2023, fighter jets moved to intercept a light aircraft that violated Washington DC airspace near the White House, before it crashed in Virginia.\\n===Closure of Pennsylvania Avenue===\\nOn May 20, 1995, primarily as a response to the Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, the United States Secret Service closed off Pennsylvania Avenue to vehicular traffic in front of the White House, from the eastern edge of Lafayette Park to 17th Street. Later, the closure was extended an additional block to the east to 15th Street, and East Executive Avenue, a small street between the White House and the Treasury Building.\\nAfter September 11, 2001, this change was made permanent, in addition to closing E Street between the South Portico of the White House and the Ellipse. In response to the Boston Marathon bombing, the road was closed to the public in its entirety for a period of two days.\\nThe Pennsylvania Avenue closure has been opposed by organized civic groups in Washington, D.C. They argue that the closing impedes traffic flow unnecessarily and is inconsistent with the well-conceived historic plan for the city. As for security considerations, they note that the White House is set much farther back from the street than numerous other sensitive federal buildings are.\\nPrior to its inclusion within the fenced compound that now includes the Old Executive Office Building to the west and the Treasury Building to the east, this sidewalk served as a queuing area for the daily public tours of the White House. These tours were suspended in the wake of the September 11 attacks. In September 2003, they resumed on a limited basis for groups making prior arrangements through their Congressional representatives or embassies in Washington for foreign nationals and submitting to background checks, but the White House remained closed to the public. Due to budget constraints, White House tours were suspended for most of 2013 due to sequestration. The White House reopened to the public in November 2013.\\n===Protection===\\nThe White House Complex is protected by the United States Secret Service and the United States Park Police.\\nDuring the 2005 presidential inauguration, NASAMS (Norwegian Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System) units were used to patrol the airspace over Washington, D.C. The same units have since been used to protect the president and all airspace around the White House, which is strictly prohibited to aircraft.\\n==See also==\\nArchitecture of Washington, D.C.\\nArt in the White House\\nCamp David\\nPedro Casanave\\nGermantown White House\\nGraphics and Calligraphy Office\\nList of largest houses in the United States\\nList of National Historic Landmarks in Washington, D.C.\\nList of the oldest buildings in Washington, D.C.\\nList of residences of presidents of the United States\\nNumber One Observatory Circle, residence of the vice president\\nReplicas of the White House\\nReported White House ghosts\\nWhite House Acquisition Trust\\nWhite House Chief Calligrapher\\nWhite House Chief Floral Designer\\nWhite House Christmas tree\\nWhite House Communications Agency\\nWhite House Endowment Trust\\nWhite House Executive Chef\\nWhite House Fellows\\nWhite House History\\nWhite House Social Secretary\\nRooms in the White House\\nWhite House COVID-19 outbreak\\n==Notes==\\n==References==\\n==Further reading==\\n==External links==\\nThe White House Historical Association, with historical photos, online tours and exhibits, timelines, and facts\\nPresident\\'s Park (White House) part of the National Park Service\\nThe White House Museum, a detailed online tour\\n* Detailed 3D computer model of White House and grounds\\nVideo tours:\\n* \\n* \\n* \\nVirtual tour of the White House provided by Google Arts & Culture\\n \\n1800 establishments in Washington, D.C.\\nBuildings and structures in the United States destroyed by arson\\nBuildings of the United States government in Washington, D.C.\\nBurned houses in the United States\\nFederal architecture in Washington, D.C.\\nHistoric house museums in Washington, D.C.\\nHomes of United States Founding Fathers\\nHouses completed in 1800\\nHouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Washington, D.C.\\nJames Hoban buildings\\nNational Historic Landmarks in Washington, D.C.\\nNeoclassical architecture in Washington, D.C.\\nPresidential homes in the United States\\nPresidential museums in Washington, D.C.\\nPresidential residences in the United States\\nPresident\\'s Park\\nRebuilt buildings and structures in the United States\\nReportedly haunted locations in Washington, D.C.'}\n",

      "{'title': 'Apple', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple', 'summary': 'An apple is a round, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus spp., among them the domestic or orchard apple; Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were introduced to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.\\nApples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics. For commercial purposes, including botanical evaluation, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting.\\nThere are more than 7,500 cultivars of apples. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw, and cider or apple juice production. Trees and fruit are prone to fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit\\'s genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.\\nWorldwide production of apples in 2021 was 93 million tonnes, with China accounting for nearly half of the total.\\n==Etymology==\\nThe word apple, whose Old English ancestor is æppel, is descended from the Proto-Germanic noun *aplaz, descended in turn from Proto-Indo-European *h₂ébōl.\\nAs late as the 17th century, the word also functioned as a generic term for all fruit, including nuts. This can be compared to the 14th-century Middle English expression appel of paradis, meaning a banana.\\n==Description==\\nThe apple is a deciduous tree, generally standing  tall in cultivation and up to  in the wild. When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by rootstock selection and trimming method. The leaves are alternately arranged dark green-colored simple ovals with serrated margins and slightly downy undersides.\\nBlossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves and are produced on spurs and some long shoots. The  flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades,  five petaled, with an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 4–6 flowers. The central flower of the inflorescence is called the \"king bloom\"; it opens first and can develop a larger fruit.\\nThe fruit is a pome that matures in late summer or autumn, and cultivars exist in a wide range of sizes. Commercial growers aim to produce an apple that is  in diameter, due to market preference. Some consumers, especially in Japan, prefer a larger apple, while apples less than  are generally used for juicing and have little fresh market value.\\n=== Skin ===\\nThe groundcolor of ripe apples is yellow, green, yellow-green or whitish yellow. The overcolor of ripe apples can be orange-red, pink-red, red, purple-red or brown-red. The skin can also be russetted. The overcolor amount can be 0-100%. The skin may also be wholly or partly russeted i.e. rough and brown. The skin is covered in a protective layer of epicuticular wax. The exocarp (flesh) is generally pale yellowish-white, though pink, yellow or green exocarps also occur.\\n=== Chemistry ===\\nImportant volatile compounds in apples include acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, 1-butanal, ethanol, 2-methylbutanal, 3-methylbutanal, ethyl propionate, ethyl 2-methylpropionate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl 2-methyl butyrate,'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Windows 11', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11', 'summary': 'Windows 11 is the latest major release of Microsoft\\'s Windows NT operating system, released on October 5, 2021. It succeeded Windows 10 (2015) and is available for free for any Windows 10 devices that meet the new Windows 11 system requirements.\\nWindows 11 features major changes to the Windows shell influenced by the canceled Windows 10X, including a redesigned Start menu, the replacement of its \"live tiles\" with a separate \"Widgets\" panel on the taskbar, the ability to create tiled sets of windows that can be minimized and restored from the taskbar as a group, and new gaming technologies inherited from Xbox Series X and Series S such as [video|Auto HDR] and DirectStorage on compatible hardware. Internet Explorer (IE) has been replaced by the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge as the default web browser, like its predecessor, Windows 10, and Microsoft Teams is integrated into the Windows shell. Microsoft also announced plans to allow more flexibility in software that can be distributed via the Microsoft Store and to support Android apps on Windows 11 (including a partnership with Amazon to make its app store available for the function).\\nCiting security considerations, the system requirements for Windows 11 were increased over Windows 10. Microsoft only officially supports the operating system on devices using an eighth-generation Intel Core CPU or newer (with some minor exceptions), a second-generation AMD Ryzen CPU or newer, or a Qualcomm Snapdragon 850 ARM system-on-chip or newer, with UEFI and Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 supported and enabled (although Microsoft may provide exceptions to the TPM 2.0 requirement for OEMs). While the OS can be installed on unsupported processors, Microsoft does not guarantee the availability of updates. Windows 11 removed support for 32-bit x86 and 32-bit ARM CPUs and devices that use BIOS firmware.\\nWindows 11 has received a mostly positive reception. Pre-release coverage of the operating system focused on its stricter hardware requirements, with discussions over whether they were legitimately intended to improve the security of Windows or as a ploy to upsell customers to newer devices and over the e-waste associated with the changes. Upon release, it was praised for its improved visual design, window management, and stronger focus on security, but was criticized for various modifications to aspects of its user interface that were seen as worse than its predecessor; some were seen as an attempt to dissuade users from switching to competing applications.\\n, Windows 11, at 27% worldwide, is the second most popular Windows version in use, with its predecessor Windows 10 at 2.5 times the market share. Windows 11 has an estimated  19.75% share of all PCs (the rest being other Windows editions and other operating systems such as macOS and Linux), and an estimated  7.8% share of all devices (including mobile, tablet and console) are running Windows 11.\\nTo comply with the Digital Markets Act, Microsoft is allowing users in the European Union to remove the Edge browser, Bing search engine, and advertisements to comply with users\\' interests.\\n==Development==\\nAt the 2015 Ignite conference, Microsoft employee Jerry Nixon stated that Windows 10 would be the \"last version of Windows\". The operating system was considered to be a service, with new builds and updates to be released over time. PC World argued that the widely reported comment was however taken out of context, noting that the official event transcript marks it only as a segue rather than a core part of the talk. It argues that Nixon was referring to the fact that he could talk freely at the event because 10 was the last version in current development.\\nIn October 2019, Microsoft announced \"Windows 10X\", a future edition of Windows 10 designed exclusively for dual-touchscreen devices such as the then-upcoming Surface Neo. It featured a modified user interface designed around context-sensitive \"postures\" for different screen configurations and usage scenarios, and changes such as a centered taskbar and updated Start menu without Windows 10\\'s \"live tiles\". Legacy Windows applications would also be required to run in \"containers\" to ensure performance and power optimization. Microsoft stated that it planned to release Windows 10X devices by the end of 2020.\\nIn May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Panos Panay, Microsoft\\'s chief product officer for Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office, stated that \"as we continue to put customers\\' needs at the forefront, we need to focus on meeting customers where they are now\", and announced that Windows 10X would only launch on single-screen devices at first, and that Microsoft would \"continue to look for the right moment, in conjunction with our OEM partners, to bring dual-screen devices to market\".\\nIn October 2020, reports emerged that Microsoft was working on a user interface refresh for Windows 10 codenamed \"Sun Valley\", scheduled to be included in a late-2021 feature update codenamed \"Cobalt\". Internal documentation stated that the aim for \"Sun Valley\" was to \"reinvigorat[e]\" the Windows user interface and make it more \"fluid\", with a more consistent application of WinUI, while reports suggested Microsoft planned to adapt UI elements seen in Windows 10X. In January 2021, it was reported that a job listing referring to a \"sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows\" had been posted by Microsoft.\\nBy December 2020, Microsoft had begun to implement and announce some of these visual changes and other new features on Windows 10 Insider Preview builds, such as new system icons (which also included the replacement of shell resources dating back as far as Windows 95), improvements to Task View to allow changing the wallpaper on each virtual desktop, x86-64 emulation on ARM, and adding the Auto HDR feature from Xbox Series X.\\nOn May 18, 2021, Head of Windows Servicing and Delivery John Cable stated that Windows 10X had been canceled and that Microsoft would be \"accelerating the integration of key foundational 10X technology into other parts of Windows and products at the company\".\\n===Announcement===\\nAt the Microsoft Build 2021 developer conference, CEO and chairman Satya Nadella teased about the existence of the next generation of Windows during his keynote speech. According to Nadella, he had been self-hosting it for several months. He also teased that an official announcement would come very soon. Just a week after Nadella\\'s keynote, Microsoft started sending invitations for a dedicated Windows media event at 11:00&nbsp;a.m. ET on June24, 2021. Microsoft also posted an 11-minute video of Windows start-up sounds to YouTube on June10, 2021, with many people speculating both the time of the Microsoft event and the duration of the Windows start-up sound video to be a reference to the name of the operating system as Windows 11.\\nOn June 24, 2021, Windows 11 was officially announced at a virtual event hosted by Chief Product Officer Panos Panay. According to Nadella, Windows 11 is \"a re-imagining of the operating system\". Further details for developers such as updates to the Microsoft Store, the new Windows App SDK (code-named \"Project Reunion\"), new Fluent Design guidelines, and more were discussed during another developer-focused event on the same day.\\n===Release and marketing===\\nThe Windows 11 name was accidentally released in an official Microsoft support document in June 2021. Leaked images of a purported beta build of Windows 11\\'s desktop surfaced online later on June 15, 2021, which were followed by a leak of the aforementioned build on the same day. The screenshots and leaked build show an interface resembling that of the canceled Windows 10X, alongside a redesigned out-of-box experience (OOBE) and Windows 11 branding. Microsoft would later confirm the authenticity of the leaked beta, with Panay stating that it was an \"early weird build\".\\nAt the June 24 media event, Microsoft also announced that Windows 11 would be released in \"Holiday 2021\". Its release will be accompanied by a free upgrade for compatible Windows 10 devices through Windows Update. On June 28, Microsoft announced the release of the first preview build and SDK of Windows 11 to Windows Insiders.\\nOn August 31, 2021, Microsoft announced that Windows 11 was to be released on October 5, 2021. The release would be phased, with newer eligible devices to be offered the upgrade first. Since its predecessor Windows 10 was released on July 29, 2015, more than six years earlier, this is the longest time span between successive releases of Microsoft Windows operating systems, beating the time between Windows XP (released on October 25, 2001) and Windows Vista (released on January 30, 2007).\\nThe first television commercial for Windows 11 premiered during the 2021 NFL Kickoff Game on September 9, 2021; it was intended to showcase a \"feeling of immersion and fluidity\", with imagery of operating system features and Xbox Game Studios\\' Halo Infinite. Other promotional campaigns on release day included the Burj Khalifa in Dubai being illuminated with imagery of the Windows 11 logo and default \"Bloom\" wallpaper, and Mikey Likes It ice cream parlors in New York City distributing free cups of \"Bloomberry\" ice cream.\\nThough a support document listed October 4, 2021, as the initial release date, Microsoft officially released Windows 11 on October 5, 2021, as an opt-in, in-place upgrade through either the Windows 11 Installation Assistant application (which can perform the upgrade, or generate an ISO image or USB install media), or via Windows Update in a phased rollout; Microsoft anticipated that Windows 11 would be available via Windows Update to all eligible devices by mid-2022. New installations of Windows 10 on eligible hardware may present an option to upgrade during the OOBE. Retail copies of Windows 11 (consisting of a license key and USB flash drive) were released on May 9, 2022, and digital licenses became available via Microsoft Store on July 28, 2022. As of October 11, 2023, around two years after the release date of Windows 11, users are no longer able to use Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 keys to activate Windows 11.\\n==Features==\\nWindows 11, the first major Windows release since 2015, builds upon its predecessor by revamping the user interface to follow Microsoft\\'s new Fluent Design guidelines. The redesign, which focuses on ease of use and flexibility, comes alongside new productivity and social features and updates to security and accessibility, addressing some of the deficiencies of Windows 10.\\nThe Microsoft Store, which serves as a unified storefront for apps and other content, is also redesigned in Windows 11. Microsoft now allows developers to distribute Win32, progressive web applications, and other packaging technologies in the Microsoft Store, alongside Universal Windows Platform apps. Microsoft also announced plans to allow third-party application stores (such as Epic Games Store) to distribute their clients on Microsoft Store. Windows 11 supports x86-64 software emulation on ARM-based platforms.\\nThe collaboration platform Microsoft Teams is integrated into the Windows 11 user interface, and is accessible via the taskbar. Skype will no longer be bundled with the OS by default. In early 2023, the Phone Link app gained limited support for iMessage.\\nMicrosoft claims performance improvements such as smaller update sizes, faster web browsing in \"any browser\", faster wake time from sleep mode, and faster Windows Hello authentication.\\nWindows 11 ships with the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge web browser (for compatibility with Google Chrome web browser), and does not include or support Internet Explorer. Its rendering engine MSHTML (Trident) is still included with the operating system for backwards compatibility reasons, and Edge can be configured with Group Policy to render whitelisted websites in \"IE Mode\" (which still uses IE\\'s rendering engine MSHTML, instead of Blink layout engine). Windows 11 is the first version of Windows since the original retail release of Windows 95 to not ship with Internet Explorer.\\nThe updated Xbox app, along with the Auto HDR and DirectStorage technologies introduced by the Xbox Series X and Series S, will be integrated into Windows 11; the latter requiring a graphics card supporting DirectX 12 and an NVMe solid-state drive.\\n===User interface===\\nA redesigned user interface is present frequently throughout the operating system, building upon the Fluent Design System; translucency, shadows, a new color palette, and a rounded geometry are prevalent throughout the UI. A prevalent aspect of the design is an appearance known as \"Mica\", described as an \"opaque, dynamic material that incorporates theme and desktop wallpaper to paint the background of long-lived windows such as apps and settings\". Much of the interface and start menu takes heavy inspiration from the now-canceled Windows 10X. The Segoe UI font used since Windows Vista has been updated to a variable version, improving its ability to scale between different display resolutions.\\nThe taskbar\\'s buttons are center-aligned by default, and it is permanently pinned to the bottom edge of the screen; it cannot be moved to the top, left, or right edges of the screen as in previous versions of Windows without manual changes to the registry. The notifications sidebar is now accessed by clicking the date and time, with other Quick Actions toggles, as well as volume, brightness, and media playback controls, moved to a new settings pop-up displayed by clicking on the system tray. The \"Widgets\" button on the taskbar displays a panel with Microsoft Start, a news aggregator with personalized stories and content (expanding upon the \"news and interests\" panel introduced in later builds of Windows 10). Microsoft Teams is similarly integrated with the taskbar, with a pop-up showing a list of recent conversations.\\nThe Start menu has been significantly redesigned, replacing the \"live tiles\" used by Windows 8.x and 10 with a grid of \"pinned\" applications, and a list of recent applications and documents. File Explorer was updated to replace its ribbon toolbar with a more traditional toolbar, while its context menus have been redesigned to move some tasks (such as copy and paste) to a toolbar along the top of the menu, and hide other operations under an overflow menu.\\nTask View, a feature introduced in Windows 10, features a refreshed design, and supports giving separate wallpapers to each virtual desktop. The window snapping functionality has been enhanced with two additional features; hovering over a window\\'s maximize button displays pre-determined \"Snap Layouts\" for tiling multiple windows onto a display, and tiled arrangement of windows can be minimized and restored from the taskbar as a \"snap group\". When a display is disconnected in a multi-monitor configuration, the windows that were previously on that display will be minimized rather than automatically moved to the main display. If the same display is reconnected, the windows are restored to their prior location.\\n===Windows Subsystem for Android===\\nOn October 21, 2021, Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) became available to Beta channel builds of Windows 11 for users in the United States, which allows users to install and run Android apps on their devices. Users can install Android apps through any source using the APK file format. An Amazon Appstore client for Microsoft Store is also available. The Windows Subsystem for Android and Amazon Appstore became available to Release channel users in the United States on February 15, 2022, in Windows 11 Release build 22000.527.\\nWSA is based on the Intel Bridge runtime compiler; Intel stated that the technology is not dependent on its CPUs, and will also be supported on x86-64 and ARM CPUs from other vendors.\\n===Setup===\\nInstallation requires internet connection and Microsoft account login is mandatory unless manually bypassed to create a local user.\\n===System security===\\nAs part of the minimum system requirements, Windows 11 only runs on devices with a Trusted Platform Module 2.0 security coprocessor. According to Microsoft, the TPM 2.0 coprocessor is a \"critical building block\" for protection against firmware and hardware attacks. In addition, Microsoft now requires devices with Windows 11 to include virtualization-based security (VBS), hypervisor-protected code integrity (HVCI), and Secure Boot built-in and enabled by default. The operating system also features hardware-enforced stack protection for supported Intel and AMD processors for protection against zero-day exploits.\\nLike its predecessor, Windows 11 also supports multi-factor authentication and biometric authentication through Windows Hello.\\n=== Artificial intelligence ===\\nIn subsequent updates, Microsoft added several features based on artificial intelligence (AI), like live captions, background noise removal in videoconferencing, webcam auto-framing that follows the user\\'s movements, and AI-powered Bing Chat in the taskbar\\'s search field. Following the integration of GPT-4 in Microsoft\\'s other products, the company announced that by summer 2023, a new Windows Copilot would add GPT-4 integration to the Windows taskbar.\\n==Versions==\\nThe Windows Insider program carries over from Windows 10, with pre-release builds divided into \"Dev\" (unstable builds used to test features for future feature updates), \"Beta\" (test builds for the next feature update; relatively stable in comparison to Dev channel), and \"Release Preview\" (pre-release builds for final testing of upcoming feature updates) channels.\\n=== Editions ===\\nWindows 11 is available in two main editions; the Home edition, which is intended for consumer users, and the Pro edition, which contains additional networking and security features (such as BitLocker), as well as the ability to join a domain. Windows 11 Home may be restricted by default to verified software obtained from Microsoft Store (\"S Mode\"). Windows 11 Home requires an Internet connection and a Microsoft account in order to complete first-time setup. This restriction is also applied to Windows 11 Pro since version 22H2 as it was announced in February 2022.\\nWindows 11 SE was announced on November 9, 2021, as an edition exclusively for low-end devices sold in the education market; it is intended as a successor to Windows 10 S, and also competes primarily with ChromeOS. It is designed to be managed via Microsoft Intune, and has changed based on feedback from educators to simplify the user interface and reduce \"distractions\", such as Snap Layouts not containing layouts for more than two applications at once, all applications opening maximized by default, and Widgets being removed. It is bundled with applications such as Microsoft Office for Microsoft 365, Minecraft Education Edition, and Flipgrid, while OneDrive is used to save files by default. Windows 11 SE does not include Microsoft Store; third-party software is provisioned or installed by administrators. To target organizations migrating from Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge is configured by default to enable the installation of extensions from the Chrome Web Store.\\n== Supported languages ==\\nBefore the launch of Windows 11, OEMs (as well as mobile operators) and businesses were offered two options for device imaging: Component-Based Servicing lp.cab files (for the languages to be preloaded on the first boot) and Local Experience Pack .appx files (for the languages available for download on supported PCs). The 38 fully-localized Language Pack (LP) languages were available as both lp.cab and .appx packages, while the remaining 72 partially-localized Language Interface Pack (LIP) languages were only available as .appx packages.\\nWith Windows 11, that process has changed. Five new LP languages were added — Catalan, Basque, Galician, Indonesian, and Vietnamese — bringing the total number of LP languages to 43. Furthermore, these 43 languages can only be imaged using lp.cab packages. This is to ensure a fully supported language-imaging and cumulative update experience.\\nThe remaining 67 LIP languages that are LXP-based will move to a self-service model, and can only be added by Windows users themselves via the Microsoft Store and Windows Settings apps, not during the Windows imaging process. Any user, not just admins, can now add both the display language and its features, which can help users in business environments, but these exact options for languages (both LP and LIP) still depend on the OEM and mobile operator.\\n==Updates and support==\\nLike Windows 10, Windows 11 follows Microsoft\\'s Modern Lifecycle Policy. Each annual feature update has its own support lifecycle: two years for the Home and Pro editions, and three years for the Education and Enterprise editions. Microsoft has stated that Windows 11 provides no lifecycle guarantee if it has been installed on a machine that does not meet its minimum hardware requirements.\\nWindows 11 receives annual major updates, though Microsoft sometimes adds major features in mid-cycle releases. Starting in 2022, in the Enterprise and Education editions, major features added in yearly releases will be turned off by default until the next yearly release, though these features can be manually enabled as a group policy.\\n==System requirements==\\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align:center;max-width:535px;font-size:90%;margin-left:1.5em\"\\n|+Hardware requirements for Windows 11\\n!Component\\n!Minimum\\n|-\\n!Processor\\n|A compatible 64-bit processor (x86-64 with SSE4.1 or ARM64 at ARMv8.1) with at least 1GHz clock rate and at least 2 processor cores\\n|-\\n!Memory (RAM)\\n|At least 4 GB\\n|-\\n!Storage space\\n|At least 64 GB\\n|-\\n!System firmware\\n|Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)\\n|-\\n!rowspan=2|Security\\n|Secure Boot (recommended but not required)\\n|-\\n|Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0\\n|-\\n!Graphics card\\n|Compatible with DirectX 12 or later with WDDM 2.0 driver\\n|-\\n!Display\\n|High definition (720p) display that is greater than 9\" diagonally, 8 bits per color channel\\n|-\\n!Internet connection and Microsoft accounts\\n|Internet connection and Microsoft account required to complete first-time setup on Windows 11 Home (also on Windows 11 Pro, since version 22H2)\\n|}\\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=text-align:center;max-width:535px;font-size:90%;margin-left:1.5em\\n|+Additional requirements for optional functionality\\n!Feature\\n!Requirements\\n|-\\n!5G support\\n|5G capable modem\\n|-\\n!Auto HDR\\n|HDR capable monitor\\n|-\\n!Biometric authentication and Windows Hello\\n|Illuminated infrared camera or fingerprint reader\\n|-\\n!BitLocker to Go\\n|USB flash drive (available in Windows 11 Pro and higher editions)\\n|-\\n!Hyper-V\\n|Second Level Address Translation (SLAT) (available in Windows 11 Pro and higher editions)\\n|-\\n!DirectStorage\\n|NVMe Solid-state drive\\n|-\\n!DirectX 12 Ultimate\\n|Available with supported games and graphics cards\\n|-\\n!Spatial sound\\n|Supporting hardware and software\\n|-\\n!Two-factor authentication\\n|Use of PIN, biometric authentication, or a phone with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth capabilities\\n|-\\n!Speech recognition\\n|Microphone\\n|-\\n!Wi-Fi 6E support\\n|New WLAN IHV hardware and driver, Wi-Fi 6E capable AP/router\\n|-\\n!Windows Projection\\n|Wi-Fi adapter that supports Wi-Fi Direct, WDDM 2.0\\n|-\\n!Windows Subsystem for Android (public preview)\\n|A supported processor and a solid-state driveAt least 8 GB of RAM (minimum)At least 16 GB of RAM (recommended)\\n|}\\n===Platform===\\nThe basic system requirements of Windows 11 differ significantly from Windows 10. Windows 11 only supports 64-bit systems such as those using an x86-64 or ARM64 processor; IA-32 and ARM32 processors are no longer supported. Thus, Windows 11 is the first consumer version of Windows not to support 32-bit processors (although Windows Server 2008 R2 is the first version of Windows Server to not support them). The minimum RAM and storage requirements were also increased; Windows 11 now requires at least 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. S mode is only supported for the Home edition of Windows 11. As of August 2021, the officially supported list of processors includes Intel Coffee Lake (eighth generation Intel Core) CPUs and later, AMD Zen+ CPUs/APUs and later (which include the \"AF\" revisions of Ryzen 1000 CPUs, which are underclocked Zen+ CPUs that supplant Ryzen 1000 parts that could no longer be manufactured due to a change in process), and Qualcomm Snapdragon 850 and later. The compatibility list includes the Intel Core i7-7820HQ, a seventh-generation processor used by the Surface Studio 2, although only on devices that shipped with DCH-based drivers. Starting from Windows 11 24H2, Microsoft is enforcing stricter rules on unsupported CPUs. PCs without the POPCNT instruction (before 2010, part of the SSE4.2 instruction set) will be unable to install or run Windows 11.\\n===Firmware compatibility===\\nLegacy BIOS is no longer supported; a UEFI system and a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 security coprocessor is now required. The TPM requirement in particular has led to confusion as many motherboards do not have TPM support, or require a compatible TPM to be physically installed onto the motherboard. Many newer CPUs also include a TPM implemented at the CPU level (with AMD referring to this as \"fTPM\", and Intel referring to it as \"Platform Trust Technology\" [PTT]), which might be disabled by default and require changing settings in the computer\\'s UEFI firmware, or a UEFI firmware update that changes the default settings to reflect these requirements.\\nOriginal equipment manufacturers (OEM) can still ship computers without a TPM 2.0 coprocessor upon Microsoft\\'s approval. Devices with unsupported processors are not blocked from installing or running Windows 11; however, a clean install or upgrade using ISO installation media must be performed as Windows Update will not offer an upgrade from Windows 10. Additionally, users must also accept an on-screen disclaimer stating that they will not be entitled to receive updates, and that damage caused by using Windows 11 on an unsupported configuration are not covered by the manufacturer\\'s warranty.\\n===Third-party software===\\nSome third-party software may refuse to run on configurations of Windows 11 that do not comply with the hardware security requirement, with Riot Games\\' multiplayer game Valorant (which uses it to strictly enforce its kernel-level anti-cheat component) being the first such example.\\n==Reception==\\n===Pre-release===\\nReception of Windows 11 upon its reveal was positive, with critics praising the new design and productivity features. However, Microsoft was criticized for creating confusion over the minimum system requirements for Windows 11. The increased system requirements (compared to those of Windows 10) initially published by Microsoft meant that up to 60 percent of existing Windows 10 PCs were unable to upgrade to Windows 11, which has faced concerns that this will contribute to electronic waste.\\nMicrosoft has not specifically acknowledged this when discussing the cutoff, it was also acknowledged that the sixth and seventh generation of Intel Core processors were prominently afflicted by CPU-level security vulnerabilities such as Meltdown and Spectre, and that newer CPUs manufactured since then had increased mitigations against the flaws.\\nSpeaking to IT news outlet CRN, a dozen independent solution providers all felt that they \"believe Windows 11 will be a meaningful step up in security, and they agree with Microsoft\\'s strategy of putting security first.\"\\nResearch Vice President of Gartner Stephen Kleynhans felt that Microsoft was \"looking at the entire stack from the hardware up through the applications and the user experience and trying to make the entire stack work better and more securely.\\n===Launch===\\nAndrew Cunningham of Ars Technica praised the improvements to its visual design (describing the new \"Mica\" appearance as reminiscent of the visual appearance of iOS and macOS, and arguing that Microsoft had \"[made] a serious effort\" at making the user-facing aspects of Windows 11 more consistent visually), window management, performance (assessed as being equivalent to if not better than Windows 10), other \"beneficial tweaks\", and its system requirements having brought greater public attention to hardware security features present on modern PCs. Criticism was raised towards Widgets\\' lack of support for third-party content (thus limiting it to Microsoft services only), regressions in taskbar functionality and customization, the inability to easily select default applications for common tasks such as web browsing (now requiring the user to select the browser application for each file type individually), and Microsoft\\'s unclear justification for its processor compatibility criteria. Cunningham concluded that \"as I\\'ve dug into [Windows 11] and learned its ins and outs for this review, I\\'ve warmed to it more\", but argued that the OS was facing similar \"public perception\" issues to Windows Vista and Windows 8. However, he noted that 11 did not have as many performance issues or bugs as Vista had upon its release, nor was as \"disjointed\" as 8, and recommended that users who were unsure about the upgrade should stay on Windows 10 in anticipation of future updates to 11.\\nTom Warren of The Verge described Windows 11 as being akin to a house in the middle of renovations, but that \"actually using Windows 11 for the past few months hasn\\'t felt as controversial as I had expected\"—praising its updated user interface as being more modern and reminiscent of iOS and ChromeOS, the new start menu for feeling less cluttered than the Windows 10 iteration, updates to some of its stock applications, and Snap Assist. Warren noted that he rarely used the Widgets panel or Microsoft Teams, citing that he preferred the weather display that later versions of Windows 10 offered, and did not use Teams to communicate with his friends and family. He also acknowledged the expansion of the Microsoft Store to include more \"traditional\" desktop applications. However, he felt that Windows 11 still felt like a work in progress, noting UI inconsistencies (such as dark mode and new context menu designs not being uniform across all dialogues and applications, and the UWP Settings app still falling back upon legacy Control Panel applets for certain settings), regressions to the taskbar (including the inability to move it, drag files onto taskbar buttons to focus the corresponding application, and the clock only shown on the primary display in multi-monitor configurations), and promised features (such as dynamic refresh rate support and a universal microphone mute button) not being present on the initial release. Overall, he concluded that \"I wouldn\\'t rush out to upgrade to Windows 11, but I also wouldn\\'t avoid it. After all, Windows 11 still feels familiar and underneath all the UI changes, it\\'s the same Windows we\\'ve had for decades.\"\\nMark Hatchman of PC World was more critical of Windows 11, arguing that it \"sacrifices productivity for personality, but without cohesion\", commenting upon changes such as the inability to use local \"offline\" accounts on Windows 11 Home, regressions to the taskbar, a \"functionally worse\" start menu, Microsoft Teams integration having privacy implications and being a ploy to coerce users into switching to the service, File Explorer obscuring common functions under unclear icons, forcing users to scroll through many options to discourage changing the default web browser from Microsoft Edge, and that the OS \"anecdotally feels less responsive, slower, and heavier than Windows 10\". He concluded that Windows 11 \"feels practical and productive, but less so than its predecessor in many aspects\", while its best features were either \"hidden deeper within\", required specific hardware (DirectStorage, Auto HDR) or were not available on launch (Android app support).\\n==See also==\\nList of operating systems\\nMicrosoft Windows\\n==References==\\n==External links==\\nWindows 11 release information from Microsoft\\nWindows 11\\n11\\n2021 software\\nAndroid (operating system)\\nARM operating systems\\nComputer-related introductions in 2021\\nProprietary operating systems\\nTablet operating systems\\nX86-64 operating systems'}\n"

Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm) with an orbital period of 11.86 years. It is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus and has been observed since prehistoric times. Its name derives from Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.\\nJupiter was the first planet to form, and its inward migration during the primordial Solar System impacted much of the formation history of the other planets. Hydrogen constitutes 90% of Jupiter's volume, followed by helium, which forms 25% of its mass and 10% of its volume. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the planet receives from the Sun. Its internal structure is believed to consist of an outer mantle of fluid metallic hydrogen and a diffuse inner core of denser material. Because of its rapid rotation rate of one rotation per ten hours, Jupiter's shape is an oblate spheroid; it possesses a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. The most obvious result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has been recorded since at least 1831.\\nJupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and has a powerful magnetosphere, the second largest contiguous structure in the Solar System (after the heliosphere). Jupiter forms a system of 95 known moons and probably many more, including the four large moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede, the largest of the four, is larger than the planet Mercury. Callisto is the second largest; Io and Europa are approximately the size of Earth's Moon.\\nSince 1973, Jupiter has been visited by nine robotic probes: seven flybys and two dedicated orbiters, with one more en route and one awaiting launch.\\n\\n\"})\n",

It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years and then become independent, leaving their mother's [range] to establish their own.\\nThe tiger was first scientifically described in 1758. It once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin in the east, and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands. Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated from Western and Central Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China. What remains of the range where tigers still roam free is fragmented, stretching in spots from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent, Indochina and a single Indonesian island, Sumatra.\\nThe tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. India hosts the largest tiger population. Major reasons for population decline are [destruction], [fragmentation] and poaching. Tigers are also victims of [conflict], due to encroachment in countries with a high human population density.\\nThe tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's charismatic megafauna.

Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Because of its retractable claws, it is adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It also secretes and perceives pheromones.\\nFemale domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Animal population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of bird, mammal and reptile species.\\n the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6&nbsp;million cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat.

A member of this family is also called a felid (). The term \"cat\" refers both to felids in general and specifically to the domestic cat (Felis catus).\\nThe 41 extant Felidae species exhibit the greatest diversity in fur patterns of all terrestrial carnivores. Cats have retractile claws, slender muscular bodies and strong flexible forelimbs. Their teeth and facial muscles allow for a powerful bite. They are all obligate carnivores, and most are solitary predators ambushing or stalking their prey. Wild cats occur in Africa, Europe, Asia and the Americas. Some wild cat species are adapted to forest and savanna habitats, some to arid environments, and a few also to wetlands and mountainous terrain. Their activity patterns range from nocturnal and crepuscular to diurnal, depending on their preferred prey species.\\nReginald Innes Pocock divided the extant Felidae into three subfamilies: the Pantherinae, the Felinae and the Acinonychinae, differing from each other by the ossification of the hyoid apparatus and by the cutaneous sheaths which protect their claws.\\nThis concept has been revised following developments in molecular biology and techniques for the analysis of morphological data. Today, the living Felidae are divided into two subfamilies: the Pantherinae and Felinae, with the Acinonychinae subsumed into the latter. Pantherinae includes five Panthera and two Neofelis species, while Felinae includes the other 34 species in 12 genera.\\nThe first cats emerged during the Oligocene about 25 million years ago, with the appearance of Proailurus and Pseudaelurus. The latter species complex was ancestral to two main lines of felids: the cats in the extant subfamilies and a group of extinct \"saber-tooth\" felids of the subfamily Machairodontinae, which range from the type genus Machairodus of the late Miocene to Smilodon of the Pleistocene.

The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.\\nEarth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry. It has a composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the planet. The water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas and, together with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), creates the conditions for both liquid surface water and water vapor to persist via the capturing of energy from the Sun's light. This process maintains the current average surface temperature of 14.76 °C (58.57 °F), at which water is liquid under atmospheric pressure. Differences in the amount of captured energy between geographic regions (as with the equatorial region receiving more sunlight than the polar regions) drive atmospheric and ocean currents, producing a global climate system with different climate regions, and a range of weather phenomena such as precipitation, allowing components such as nitrogen to cycle.\\nEarth is rounded into an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light-minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 384,400 km (1.28 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. The Moon's gravity helps stabilize Earth's axis, causes tides and gradually slows Earth's rotation. Tidal locking has made the Moon always face Earth with the same side.\\nEarth, like most other bodies in the Solar System, formed 4.5 billion years ago from gas in the early Solar System. During the first billion years of Earth's history, the ocean formed and then life developed within it. Life spread globally and has been altering Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the Great Oxidation Event two billion years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago in Africa and have spread across every continent on Earth. Humans depend on Earth's biosphere and natural resources for their survival, but have increasingly impacted the planet's environment. Humanity's current impact on Earth's climate and biosphere is unsustainable, threatening the livelihood of humans and many other forms of life, and causing widespread extinctions.\"})\n",
      "  ('Jupiter', {'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter', 'summary': \"Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. A gas giant, Jupiter's mass is more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined and slightly less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm) with an orbital period of 11.86 years. It is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus and has been observed since prehistoric times. Its name derives from Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.\\nJupiter was the first planet to form, and its inward migration during the primordial Solar System impacted much of the formation history of the other planets. Hydrogen constitutes 90% of Jupiter's volume, followed by helium, which forms 25% of its mass and 10% of its volume. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the planet receives from the Sun. Its internal structure is believed to consist of an outer mantle of fluid metallic hydrogen and a diffuse inner core of denser material. Because of its rapid rotation rate of one rotation per ten hours, Jupiter's shape is an oblate spheroid; it possesses a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. The most obvious result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that has been recorded since at least 1831.\\nJupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and has a powerful magnetosphere, the second largest contiguous structure in the Solar System (after the heliosphere). Jupiter forms a system of 95 known moons and probably many more, including the four large moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede, the largest of the four, is larger than the planet Mercury. Callisto is the second largest; Io and Europa are approximately the size of Earth's Moon.\\nSince 1973, Jupiter has been visited by nine robotic probes: seven flybys and two dedicated orbiters, with one more en route and one awaiting launch.\"})\n",

It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail, and distinctive black, mostly vertical stripes on orange fur. It was first scientifically described in 1758 and is traditionally classified into eight recent subspecies though some recognise only two subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and island tigers of the Sunda Islands.\\nThroughout the tiger's range, it inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the Russian Far East and Northeast China to tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests on the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The tiger is an apex predator and preys mainly on ungulates such as deer and wild boar, which it takes by ambush. It lives a mostly solitary life and occupies home ranges, which it defends from individuals of the same sex. The range of a male tiger overlaps with that of multiple females with which he has reproductive claims. Females give birth to usually two or three cubs that stay with their mother for about two years. When becoming independent, they leave their mother's home range and establish their own.\\nSince the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and are locally extinct in West and Central Asia, in large areas of China and on the islands of Java and Bali. Today, the tiger's range is severely fragmented. The species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List, as its range is thought to have declined by 53% to 68% since the late 1990s. Major reasons for this decline are habitat destruction and habitat fragmentation due to deforestation, and poaching for fur and illegal trade of tiger body parts for medicinal purposes. Tigers are also victims of human–wildlife conflict, due to encroachment in countries with a high human population density. Tigers sometimes attack and even prey on people.\\nThe tiger is among the most popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. It has been kept in captivity since ancient times, and has been trained to perform in circuses and other entertainment shows. The species has been popular in the exotic pet trade. The tiger featured prominently in the ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range and has continued to appear in culture worldwide.\\n\\n\"})\n",

It is the only domesticed species in the family Felidae. Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Its retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It also secretes and perceives pheromones.\\nFemale domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout the year in equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Animal population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of bird, mammal and reptile species.\\nAs of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020. As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.\\n\\n'})\n",

A member of this family is also called a felid (). The term \"cat\" refers both to felids in general and specifically to the domestic cat (Felis catus).\\nThe 41 extant Felidae species exhibit the greatest diversity in fur patterns of all terrestrial carnivores. Cats have retractile claws, slender muscular bodies and strong flexible forelimbs. Their teeth and facial muscles allow for a powerful bite. They are all obligate carnivores, and most are solitary predators ambushing or stalking their prey. Wild cats occur in Africa, Europe, Asia and the Americas. Some wild cat species are adapted to forest and savanna habitats, some to arid environments, and a few also to wetlands and mountainous terrain. Their activity patterns range from nocturnal and crepuscular to diurnal, depending on their preferred prey species.\\nReginald Innes Pocock divided the extant Felidae into three subfamilies: the Pantherinae, the Felinae and the Acinonychinae, differing from each other by the ossification of the hyoid apparatus and by the cutaneous sheaths which protect their claws.\\nThis concept has been revised following developments in molecular biology and techniques for the analysis of morphological data. Today, the living Felidae are divided into two subfamilies: the Pantherinae and Felinae, with the Acinonychinae subsumed into the latter. Pantherinae includes five Panthera and two Neofelis species, while Felinae includes the other 34 species in 12 genera.\\nThe first cats emerged during the Oligocene about 25 million years ago, with the appearance of Proailurus and Pseudaelurus. The latter species complex was ancestral to two main lines of felids: the cats in the extant subfamilies and a group of extinct \"saber-tooth\" felids of the subfamily Machairodontinae, which range from the type genus Machairodus of the late Miocene to Smilodon of the Pleistocene. The \"false saber-toothed cats\", the Barbourofelidae and Nimravidae, are not true cats but are closely related. Together with the Felidae, Viverridae, hyenas and mongooses, they constitute the Feliformia.\\n\\n'})\n",

The functions of a ninja included siege and infiltration, ambush, reconnaissance, espionage, deception, and later bodyguarding and their fighting skills in martial arts, including ninjutsu. Their covert methods of waging irregular warfare were deemed dishonorable and beneath the honor of the samurai. Though shinobi proper, as specially trained warriors, spies, and mercenaries, appeared in the 15th century during the Sengoku period, antecedents may have existed as early as the 12th century.\\nIn the unrest of the Sengoku period, jizamurai families, that is, elite peasant-warriors, in Iga Province and the adjacent Kōka District formed ikki – \"revolts\" or \"leagues\" – as a means of self-defense. They became known for their military activities in the nearby regions and sold their services as mercenaries and spies. It is from these areas that much of the knowledge regarding the ninja is drawn. Following the unification of Japan under the Tokugawa shogunate in the 17th century, the ninja faded into obscurity. A number of shinobi manuals, often based on Chinese military philosophy, were written in the 17th and 18th centuries, most notably the Bansenshūkai (1676).\\nBy the time of the Meiji Restoration (1868), shinobi had become a topic of popular imagination and mystery in Japan. Ninja figured prominently in legend and folklore, where they were associated with legendary abilities such as invisibility, walking on water, and control over natural elements.

It is followed by the sequel series Boruto: Naruto Next Generations by Ukyō Kodachi, which continues where the epilogue of the first series left off. The series\\' storyline follows the adventures of a group of young ninja from the village of Konohagakure (Village Hidden in the Tree Leaves).\\nThe eponymous character of the first series is Naruto Uzumaki, an energetic ninja who wishes to become Hokage, the leader of Konohagakure and holds a monster called the Nine Tails in his body. During the early part of the series, Naruto is assigned to Team 7, in which he meets his rival Sasuke Uchiha, a taciturn and highly skilled \"genius\" of the Uchiha clan; Sakura Haruno, who is infatuated with Sasuke and has Naruto\\'s attention and Kakashi Hatake, the quiet and mysterious leader of the team. Over the course of the series, seeking out Sasuke when he ran away from the village, Naruto interacts with and befriends several fellow ninja in Konohagakure and other villages. He also encounters the series\\' antagonists, including Orochimaru, a former ninja of Konohagakure scheming to destroy his former home, as well as the elite ninja of the criminal organization Akatsuki who seek out jinchuriki like Gaara for the tailed beasts.\\nThe eponymous character of the second series is Boruto Uzumaki, the son of Naruto and Hinata Hyuga who is assigned to Team Konohamaru also known as Team 7, which includes Sasuke and Sakura\\'s daughter – Sarada Uchiha, Orochimaru\\'s artificially created son – Mitsuki and the group\\'s leader – Konohamaru, the Third Hokage\\'s grandson whom Naruto befriended as a child. Subsequently, Sarada is promoted to leader of the team in place of Konohamaru and joins them Kawaki, a young boy with a traumatic past who is taken in by the Uzumaki family, thus becoming the adopted son of Naruto and the adoptive brother of Boruto.\\nAs Kishimoto developed the series, he created the three primary characters as a basis for the designs of the other three-person teams. He also used characters in other shōnen manga as references in his design of the characters, a decision that was criticized by several anime and manga publications. The characters that Kishimoto developed, however, were praised for incorporating many of the better aspects of previous shōnen characters, although many publications lamented the perceived lack of growth beyond such stereotypes. The visual presentation of the characters was commented on by reviewers, with both praise and criticism given to Kishimoto\\'s work in the manga and anime adaptations.'})\n",

       "{'Kunai': \"A kunai (苦無, kunai) is a Japanese tool thought to be originally derived from the masonry trowel. The two widely recognized kinds are the short kunai (小苦無 shō-kunai) and the big kunai (大苦無 dai-kunai). Although a basic tool, the kunai, in the hands of a martial arts expert, could be used as a multi-functional weapon. The kunai is commonly associated with the ninja, who in folklore use them to climb walls. \\n== Design == A Kunai normally had a leaf-shaped wrought blade in lengths ranging from 20 and 30 cm (7.9 and 11.8 in) and a handle with a ring on the pommel for attaching a rope. The attached rope allowed the kunai's handle to be wrapped to function as a grip, or to be strapped to a stick as a makeshift spear; to be tied to the body for concealment; to be used as an anchor or piton, and sometimes to be used as the Chinese rope dart. Contrary to popular belief, kunai were not designed to be used primarily as throwing weapons. Instead, kunai were primarily tools and, when used as weapons, were stabbing and thrusting implements.\\nVarieties of kunai include short, long, narrow-bladed, saw-toothed, and wide-bladed. In some cases, the kunai and the Nishikori, a wide-bladed saw with a dagger-type handle, are difficult to distinguish. \\n== Uses == The kunai was originally used by peasants as a multi-purpose gardening tool and by workers of stone and masonry. The blade is made of soft iron and is left unsharpened because the edges are used to smash relatively soft materials such as plaster and wood, for digging holes, and for prying. Normally, only the tip is sharpened. \\n=== Weapon ===\\nMany ninja weapons were adapted from farming tools, not unlike those used by Shaolin monks in China. Since kunai were cheaply produced farming tools of proper size and weight and could be easily sharpened, they were readily available to be converted into simple weapons.  As a weapon, the kunai is larger and heavier than a shuriken and with the grip could also be used in hand-to-hand combat more readily than a shuriken. \\nAs with ninjutsu, the exaggeration persistent in ninja myths played a large role in creating the popular culture image of kunai. In fictional depictions of ninjas, the kunai is commonly portrayed as a steel knife that is used for stabbing or particularly throwing, sometimes confused with the shuriken. \\n=== Masonry ===\\nThe kunai was used in masonry to shape stonework. \\n== See also ==\\nHori hori\\nShuriken\\nTantō\\nThrowing knife\\nTrowel \\n== References == \\n== Sources ==\\nTurnbull, Stephen (2003).

       " 'Ninja': 'A ninja (Japanese: 忍者, lit.\\u2009\\'one who is invisible\\'; [ɲiꜜɲdʑa]) or shinobi (Japanese: 忍び, lit.\\u2009\\'one who sneaks\\'; [ɕinobi]) was a covert agent, mercenary, or guerrilla warfare expert in feudal Japan. The functions of a ninja included siege and infiltration, ambush, reconnaissance, espionage, deception, and later bodyguarding and their fighting skills in martial arts, including ninjutsu. Their covert methods of waging irregular warfare were deemed dishonorable and beneath the honor of the samurai. Though shinobi proper, as specially trained warriors, spies, and mercenaries, appeared in the 15th century during the Sengoku period, antecedents may have existed as early as the 12th century.\\nIn the unrest of the Sengoku period, jizamurai families, that is, elite peasant-warriors, in Iga Province and the adjacent Kōka District formed ikki – \"revolts\" or \"leagues\" – as a means of self-defense. They became known for their military activities in the nearby regions and sold their services as mercenaries and spies. It is from these areas that much of the knowledge regarding the ninja is drawn. Following the unification of Japan under the Tokugawa shogunate in the 17th century, the ninja faded into obscurity. A number of shinobi manuals, often based on Chinese military philosophy, were written in the 17th and 18th centuries, most notably the Bansenshūkai (1676).\\nBy the time of the Meiji Restoration (1868), shinobi had become a topic of popular imagination and mystery in Japan. Ninja figured prominently in legend and folklore, where they were associated with legendary abilities such as invisibility, walking on water, and control over natural elements. Much of their perception in popular culture is based on such legends and folklore, as opposed to the covert actors of the Sengoku period. \\n== Etymology == Ninja is the on\\'yomi (Early Middle Chinese–influenced) reading of the two kanji \"忍者\". In the native kun\\'yomi reading, it is pronounced shinobi, a shortened form of shinobi-no-mono (忍びの者).\\nThe word shinobi appears in the written record as far back as the late 8th century in poems in the Man\\'yōshū. The underlying connotation of shinobi (忍) means \"to steal away; to hide\" and—by extension—\"to forbear\", hence its association with stealth and invisibility. Mono (者) means \"a person\".\\nHistorically, the word ninja was not in common use, and a variety of regional colloquialisms evolved to describe what would later be dubbed ninja. Along with shinobi, these include monomi (\"one who sees\"), nokizaru (\"macaque on the roof\"), rappa (\"ruffian\"), kusa (\"grass\") and Iga-mono (\"one from Iga\"). In historical documents, shinobi is almost always used.\\nKunoichi (くノ一) is, originally, an argot which means \"woman\";:\\u200ap168\\u200a it supposedly comes from the characters くノ一 (respectively hiragana ku, katakana no and kanji ichi), which make up the three strokes that form the kanji for \"woman\" (女).:\\u200ap168\\u200a In fiction written in the modern era kunoichi means \"female ninja\".:\\u200ap167\\u200a\\nIn the Western world, the word ninja became more prevalent than shinobi in the post–World War II culture, possibly because it was more comfortable for Western speakers. In English, the plural of ninja can be either unchanged as ninja, reflecting the Japanese language\\'s lack of grammatical number, or the regular English plural ninjas. \\n== History == Despite many popular folktales, historical accounts of the ninja are scarce. Historian Stephen Turnbull asserts that the ninja were mostly recruited from the lower class, and therefore little literary interest was taken in them. The social origin of the ninja is seen as the reason they agree to operate in secret, trading their service for money without honor and glory. The scarcity of historical accounts is also demonstrated in war epics such as The Tale of Hōgen (Hōgen Monogatari) and The Tale of the Heike (Heike Monogatari), which focus mainly on the aristocratic samurai, whose deeds were apparently more appealing to the audience.\\nHistorian Kiyoshi Watatani states that the ninja were trained to be particularly secretive about their actions and existence: So-called ninjutsu techniques, in short are the skills of shinobi-no-jutsu and shinobijutsu, which have the aims of ensuring that one\\'s opponent does not know of one\\'s existence, and for which there was special training.\\nHowever, some ninjutsu books described specifically what tactics ninja should use to fight, and the scenarios a ninja might find themselves can be deduced from those tactics. For example, in the manuscript of volume 2 of Kanrin Seiyō (間林清陽) which is the original book of Bansenshūkai (万川集海), there are 48 points of ninja\\'s fighting techniques, such as how to make makibishi from bamboo, how to make footwear that makes no sound, fighting techniques when surrounded by many enemies, precautions when using swords at night, how to listen to small sounds, kuji-kiri that prevents guard dogs from barking, and so on. \\n=== Predecessors === The title ninja has sometimes been attributed retrospectively to the semi-legendary 2nd-century prince Yamato Takeru. In the Kojiki, the young Yamato Takeru disguised himself as a charming maiden and assassinated two chiefs of the Kumaso people. However, these records take place at a very early stage of Japanese history, and they are unlikely to be connected to the shinobi of later accounts. The first recorded use of espionage was under the employment of Prince Shōtoku in the 6th century. Such tactics were considered unsavory even in early times, when, according to the 10th-century Shōmonki, the boy spy Hasetsukabe no Koharumaru was killed for spying against the insurgent Taira no Masakado. Later, the 14th-century war chronicle Taiheiki contained many references to shinobi and credited the destruction of a castle by fire to an unnamed but \"highly skilled shinobi\". \\n=== Early history ===\\nIt was not until the 15th century that spies were specially trained for their purpose. It was around this time that the word shinobi appeared to define and clearly identify ninja as a secretive group of agents. Evidence for this can be seen in historical documents, which began to refer to stealthy soldiers as shinobi during the Sengoku period. Later manuals regarding espionage are often grounded in Chinese military strategy, quoting works such as The Art of War by Sun Tzu.\\nThe ninja emerged as mercenaries in the 15th century, where they were recruited as spies, raiders, arsonists and even terrorists. Amongst the samurai, a sense of ritual and decorum was observed, where one was expected to fight or duel openly. Combined with the unrest of the Sengoku period, these factors created a demand for men willing to commit deeds considered disreputable for conventional warriors. By the Sengoku period, the shinobi had several roles, including spy (kanchō), scout (teisatsu), surprise attacker (kishu), and agitator (konran). The ninja families were organized into larger guilds, each with their own territories. A system of rank existed. A jōnin (\"upper person\") was the highest rank, representing the group and hiring out mercenaries. This is followed by the chūnin (\"middle person\"), assistants to the jōnin. At the bottom was the genin (\"lower person\"), field agents drawn from the lower class and assigned to carry out actual missions. \\n=== Iga and Kōga clans === The Iga and Kōga \"clans\" were jizamurai families living in the province of Iga (modern Mie Prefecture) and the adjacent region of Kōka (later written as Kōga), named after a village in what is now Shiga Prefecture. From these regions, villages devoted to the training of ninja first appeared. The remoteness and inaccessibility of the surrounding mountains in Iga may have had a role in the ninja\\'s secretive development. Historical documents regarding the ninja\\'s origins in these mountainous regions are considered generally correct. The chronicle Go Kagami Furoku writes, of the two clans\\' origins: There was a retainer of the family of Kawai Aki-no-kami of Iga, of pre-eminent skill in shinobi, and consequently for generations the name of people from Iga became established. Another tradition grew in Kōga.\\nLikewise, a supplement to the Nochi Kagami, a record of the Ashikaga shogunate, confirms the same Iga origin: Inside the camp at Magari of the shōgun [Ashikaga] Yoshihisa there were shinobi whose names were famous throughout the land. When Yoshihisa attacked Rokkaku Takayori, the family of Kawai Aki-no-kami of Iga, who served him at Magari, earned considerable merit as shinobi in front of the great army of the shōgun. Since then successive generations of Iga men have been admired. This is the origin of the fame of the men of Iga.\\nA distinction is to be made between the ninja from these areas, and commoners or samurai hired as spies or mercenaries. Unlike their counterparts, the Iga and Kōga clans were professionals, specifically trained for their roles. These professional ninja were actively hired by daimyōs between 1485 and 1581. Specifically, the Iga professionals were sought after for their skill at siege warfare, or \"shirotori\", which included night attacks and ambush. By the 1460s, the leading families in the regions had established de facto independence from their shugo. The Kōka ikki persisted until 1574, when it was forced to become a vassal of Oda Nobunaga. The Iga ikki continued until 1581, when Nobunaga invaded Iga Province and wiped out the organized clans. Survivors were forced to flee, some to the mountains of Kii, but others arrived before Tokugawa Ieyasu, where they were well treated. Some former Iga clan members, including Hattori Hanzō, would later serve as Tokugawa\\'s bodyguards. Prior to the conquest of Kōka in 1574, the two confederacies worked in alliance together from at least 1487.\\nFollowing the Battle of Okehazama in 1560, Tokugawa employed a group of eighty Kōga ninja, led by Tomo Sukesada. They were tasked to raid an outpost of the Imagawa clan. The account of this assault is given in the Mikawa Go Fudoki, where it was written that Kōga ninja infiltrated the castle, set fire to its towers, and killed the castellan along with two hundred of the garrison. The Kōga ninja are said to have played a role in the later Battle of Sekigahara (1600), where several hundred Kōga assisted soldiers under Torii Mototada in the defence of Fushimi Castle. After Tokugawa\\'s victory at Sekigahara, the Iga acted as guards for the inner compounds of Edo Castle, while the Kōga acted as a police force and assisted in guarding the outer gate. In 1614, the initial \"winter campaign\" at the Siege of Osaka saw the ninja in use once again. Miura Yoemon, a ninja in Tokugawa\\'s service, recruited shinobi from the Iga region, and sent 10 ninja into Osaka Castle in an effort to foster antagonism between enemy commanders. During the later \"summer campaign\", these hired ninja fought alongside regular troops at the Battle of Tennōji. \\n=== Shimabara rebellion === A final but detailed record of ninja employed in open warfare occurred during the Shimabara Rebellion (1637–1638). The Kōga ninja were recruited by shōgun Tokugawa Iemitsu against Christian rebels led by Amakusa Shirō, who made a final stand at Hara Castle, in Hizen Province. A diary kept by a member of the Matsudaira clan, the Amakusa Gunki, relates: \"Men from Kōga in Ōmi Province who concealed their appearance would steal up to the castle every night and go inside as they pleased.\"\\nThe Ukai diary, written by a descendant of Ukai Kanemon, has several entries describing the reconnaissance actions taken by the Kōga. They [the Kōga] were ordered to reconnoitre the plan of construction of Hara Castle, and surveyed the distance from the defensive moat to the ni-no-maru (second bailey), the depth of the moat, the conditions of roads, the height of the wall, and the shape of the loopholes. Suspecting that the castle\\'s supplies might be running low, the siege commander Matsudaira Nobutsuna ordered a raid on the castle\\'s provisions. Here, the Kōga captured bags of enemy provisions, and infiltrated the castle by night, obtaining secret passwords. Days later, Nobutsuna ordered an intelligence gathering mission to determine the castle\\'s supplies. Several Kōga ninja—some apparently descended from those involved in the 1562 assault on an Imagawa clan castle—volunteered despite being warned that chances of survival were slim. A volley of shots was fired into the sky, causing the defenders to extinguish the castle lights in preparation. Under the cloak of darkness, ninja disguised as defenders infiltrated the castle, capturing a banner of the Christian cross. The Ukai diary writes, We dispersed spies who were prepared to die inside Hara castle. ... those who went on the reconnaissance in force captured an enemy flag; both Arakawa Shichirobei and Mochizuki Yo\\'emon met extreme resistance and suffered from their serious wounds for 40 days.\\nAs the siege went on, the extreme shortage of food later reduced the defenders to eating moss and grass. This desperation would mount to futile charges by the rebels, where they were eventually defeated by the shogunate army. The Kōga would later take part in conquering the castle: More and more general raids were begun, the Kōga ninja band under the direct control of Matsudaira Nobutsuna captured the ni-no-maru and the san-no-maru (outer bailey) ...\\nWith the fall of Hara Castle, the Shimabara Rebellion came to an end, and Christianity in Japan was forced underground. These written accounts are the last mention of ninja in war. \\n=== Edo period ===\\nAfter the Shimabara Rebellion, there were almost no major wars or battles until the bakumatsu era. To earn a living, ninja had to be employed by the governments of their Han (domain), or change their profession. Many lords still hired ninja, not for battle but as bodyguards or spies. Their duties included spying on other domains, guarding the daimyō, and fire patrol. A few domains like Tsu, Hirosaki and Saga continued to employ their own ninja into the bakumatsu era, although their precise numbers are unknown.\\nMany former ninja were employed as security guards by the Tokugawa shogunate, though the role of espionage was transferred to newly created organizations like the onmitsu and the oniwaban. Others used their ninjutsu knowledge to become doctors, medicine sellers, merchants, martial artists, and fireworks manufacturers. Some unemployed ninja were reduced to banditry, such as Fūma Kotarō and Ishikawa Goemon. \\n==== Oniwaban ==== In the early 18th century, shogun Tokugawa Yoshimune founded the oniwaban (\"garden keepers\"), an intelligence agency and secret service. Members of the oniwaban were agents involved in collecting information on daimyō and government officials. The secretive nature of the oniwaban—along with the earlier tradition of using Iga and Kōga clan members as palace guards—have led some sources to define the oniwabanshū as \"ninja\". This portrayal is also common in later novels and jidaigeki. However, there is no written link between the earlier shinobi and the later oniwaban. \\n==== Ninja stereotypes in theatre ====\\nMany ubiquitous stereotypes about ninja were developed within Edo theatre. These include their black clothing, which was supposed to imitate the outfits worn by kuroko, stagehands meant to be ignored by the audience; and their use of shuriken, which was meant to contrast with the use of swords by onstage samurai. In kabuki theatre, ninja were \"dishonorable and often sorcerous counterparts\" to samurai, and possessed \"almost, if not outright, magical means of camouflage.\" \\n=== Contemporary === Between 1960 and 2010 artifacts dating to the Siege of Odawara (1590) were uncovered which experts say are ninja weapons. Ninja were spies and saboteurs and likely participated in the siege. The Hojo clan failed to save the castle from Toyotomi Hideyoshi forces. The uncovered flat throwing stones are likely predecessors of the shuriken. The clay caltrops preceded makibishi caltrops. Archeologist Iwata Akihiro of Saitama Prefectural Museum of History and Folklore said the flat throwing stones \"were used to stop the movement of the enemy who was going to attack [a soldier] at any moment, and while the enemy freezed the soldier escaped,\". The clay caltrops could \"stop the movement of the enemy who invaded the castle,\" These weapons were hastily constructed yet effective and used by a \"battle group which can move into action as ninjas\".\\nIn 2012, Jinichi Kawakami, the last authentic heir of ninjutsu, decided against passing on his teaching to any student, stating that the art of ninjutsu has no place in modern times. Instead, Kawakami serves as the honorary director of the Iga-ryu Ninja Museum and researches ninjutsu as a specially appointed professor at Mie University.\\nMie University founded the world\\'s first research centre devoted to the ninja in 2017. A graduate master course opened in 2018. It is located in Iga (now Mie Prefecture). There are approximately 3 student enrollments per year. Students must pass an admission test about Japanese history and be able to read historical ninja documents. Scientific researchers and scholars of different disciplines study ancient documents and how it can be used in the modern world.\\nIn 2020, the 45-year-old Genichi Mitsuhashi was the first student to graduate from the master course of ninja studies at Mie University. For 2 years he studied historical records and the traditions of the martial art. Similar to the original ninja, by day he was a farmer and grew vegetables while he did ninja studies and trained martial arts in the afternoon.\\nOn June 19, 2022, Kōka city in Shiga Prefecture announced that a written copy of \"Kanrinseiyo\", which is the original source of a famous book on the art of ninja called \"Bansenshukai\" (1676) from the Edo period was discovered in a warehouse of Kazuraki Shrine. The handwritten reproduction was produced in 1748. The book describes 48 types of ninjutsu. It has information about specific methods such as attaching layers of cotton to the bottom of straw sandals to prevent noise when sneaking around, attacking to the right when surrounded by a large number of enemies, throwing charred owl and turtle powder when trying to hide, and casting spells. It also clarified methods and how to manufacture and use ninjutsu tools, such as cane swords and \"makibishi\" (Japanese caltrop). \\n== Roles ==\\nThe ninja were stealth soldiers and mercenaries hired mostly by daimyōs. Their primary roles were those of espionage and sabotage, although assassinations were also attributed to ninja. Although they were considered the anti-samurai and were disdained by those belonging to the samurai class, they were necessary for warfare and were even employed by the samurai themselves to carry out operations that were forbidden by bushidō. \\nIn his Buke Myōmokushō, military historian Hanawa Hokinoichi writes of the ninja: They travelled in disguise to other territories to judge the situation of the enemy, they would inveigle their way into the midst of the enemy to discover gaps, and enter enemy castles to set them on fire, and carried out assassinations, arriving in secret. \\n=== Espionage ===\\nEspionage was the chief role of the ninja. With the aid of disguises, the ninja gathered information on enemy terrain and building specifications, as well as obtaining passwords and communiques. The aforementioned supplement to the Nochi Kagami briefly describes the ninja\\'s role in espionage: Concerning ninja, they were said to be from Iga and Kōga, and went freely into enemy castles in secret. They observed hidden things, and were taken as being friends.\\nLater in history, the Kōga ninja would become regarded as agents of the Tokugawa bakufu, at a time when the bakufu used the ninja in an intelligence network to monitor regional daimyōs as well as the Imperial court. \\n=== Sabotage ===\\nArson was the primary form of sabotage practiced by the ninja, who targeted castles and camps.\\nThe Tamon-in Nikki (16th century)—a diary written by abbot Eishun of Kōfuku-ji temple—describes an arson attack on a castle by men of the Iga clans. This morning, the sixth day of the 11th month of Tenbun 10 [1541], the Iga-shu entered Kasagi castle in secret and set fire to a few of the priests\\' quarters. They also set fire to outbuildings in various places inside the San-no-maru. They captured the ichi-no-maru (inner bailey) and the ni-no-maru (second bailey).\\nIn 1558, Rokkaku Yoshikata employed a team of ninja to set fire to Sawayama Castle. A chūnin captain led a force of 48 ninja into the castle by means of deception. In a technique dubbed bakemono-jutsu (\"ghost technique\"), his men stole a lantern bearing the enemy\\'s family crest (mon), and proceeded to make replicas with the same mon. By wielding these lanterns, they were allowed to enter the castle without a fight. Once inside, the ninja set fire to the castle, and Yoshitaka\\'s army would later emerge victorious. The mercenary nature of the shinobi is demonstrated in another arson attack soon after the burning of Sawayama Castle. In 1561, commanders acting under Kizawa Nagamasa hired three Iga ninja of genin rank to assist the conquest of a fortress in Maibara. Rokkaku Yoshitaka, the same man who had hired Iga ninja just years earlier, was the fortress holder—and target of attack. The Asai Sandaiki writes of their plans: \"We employed shinobi-no-mono of Iga... They were contracted to set fire to the castle\". However, the mercenary shinobi were unwilling to take commands. When the fire attack did not begin as scheduled, the Iga men told the commanders, who were not from the region, that they could not possibly understand the tactics of the shinobi. They then threatened to abandon the operation if they were not allowed to act on their own strategy. The fire was eventually set, allowing Nagamasa\\'s army to capture the fortress in a chaotic rush. \\n=== Assassination === The best-known cases of assassination attempts involve famous historical figures. Deaths of famous persons have sometimes been attributed to assassination by ninja, but the secretive natures of these scenarios have made them difficult to prove. Assassins were often identified as ninja later on, but there is no evidence to prove whether some were specially trained for the task or simply a hired thug.\\nThe warlord Oda Nobunaga\\'s notorious reputation led to several attempts on his life. In 1571, a Kōga ninja and sharpshooter by the name of Sugitani Zenjubō was hired to assassinate Nobunaga. Using two arquebuses, he fired two consecutive shots at Nobunaga, but was unable to inflict mortal injury through Nobunaga\\'s armor. Sugitani managed to escape, but was caught four years later and put to death by torture. In 1573, Manabe Rokurō, a vassal of daimyō Hatano Hideharu, attempted to infiltrate Azuchi Castle and assassinate the sleeping Nobunaga. However, this also ended in failure, and Manabe was forced to commit suicide, after which his body was openly displayed in public. According to a document, the Iranki, when Nobunaga was inspecting Iga province—which his army had devastated—a group of three ninja shot at him with large-caliber firearms. The shots flew wide of Nobunaga, however, and instead killed seven of his surrounding companions.\\nThe ninja Hachisuka Tenzō was sent by Nobunaga to assassinate the powerful daimyō Takeda Shingen, but ultimately failed in his attempts. Hiding in the shadow of a tree, he avoided being seen under the moonlight, and later concealed himself in a hole he had prepared beforehand, thus escaping capture.\\nAn assassination attempt on Toyotomi Hideyoshi was also thwarted. A ninja named Kirigakure Saizō (possibly Kirigakure Shikaemon) thrust a spear through the floorboards to kill Hideyoshi, but was unsuccessful. He was \"smoked out\" of his hiding place by another ninja working for Hideyoshi, who apparently used a sort of primitive \"flamethrower\". Unfortunately, the veracity of this account has been clouded by later fictional publications depicting Saizō as one of the legendary Sanada Ten Braves.\\nUesugi Kenshin, the famous daimyō of Echigo Province, was rumored to have been killed by a ninja. The legend credits his death to an assassin who is said to have hidden in Kenshin\\'s lavatory, and fatally injured Kenshin by thrusting a blade or spear into his anus. While historical records showed that Kenshin suffered abdominal problems, modern historians have generally attributed his death to stomach cancer, esophageal cancer, or cerebrovascular disease. \\n=== Psychological warfare ===\\nIn battle, the ninja were also used to cause confusion amongst the enemy. A degree of psychological warfare in the capturing of enemy banners can be seen illustrated in the Ōu Eikei Gunki, composed between the 16th and 17th centuries: Within Hataya castle there was a glorious shinobi whose skill was renowned, and one night he entered the enemy camp secretly. He took the flag from Naoe Kanetsugu\\'s guard ... and returned and stood it on a high place on the front gate of the castle.Ninja spread conspiracy theories in states they opposed or wanted to gain power in, and ninja of various opposed and allied social classes and factions indirectly and directly played a role in spreading the popular stereotypes about them in the Tokugawa shogunate to conceal their activities. \\n=== Countermeasures ===\\nA variety of countermeasures were taken to prevent the activities of the ninja. Precautions were often taken against assassinations, such as weapons concealed in the lavatory, or under a removable floorboard. Buildings were constructed with traps and trip wires attached to alarm bells.\\nJapanese castles were designed to be difficult to navigate, with winding routes leading to the inner compound. Blind spots and holes in walls provided constant surveillance of these labyrinthine paths, as exemplified in Himeji Castle. Nijō Castle in Kyoto is constructed with long \"nightingale\" floors, which rested on metal hinges (uguisu-bari) specifically designed to squeak loudly when walked over. Grounds covered with gravel also provided early notice of unwanted intruders, and segregated buildings allowed fires to be better contained. \\n== Training ==\\nThe skills required of the ninja have come to be known in modern times as ninjutsu (忍術), but it is unlikely they were previously named under a single discipline, rather distributed among a variety of espionage and survival skills. Some view ninjutsu as evidence that ninja were not simple mercenaries because texts contained not only information on combat training, but also information about daily needs, which even included mining techniques. The guidance provided for daily work also included elements that enable the ninja to understand the martial qualities of even the most menial task. These factors show how the ninjutsu established among the ninja class the fundamental principle of adaptation. The first specialized training began in the mid-15th century, when certain samurai families started to focus on covert warfare, including espionage and assassination. Like the samurai, ninja were born into the profession, where traditions were kept in, and passed down through the family. According to Turnbull, the ninja was trained from childhood, as was also common in samurai families.\\nOutside the expected martial art disciplines, a youth studied survival and scouting techniques, as well as information regarding poisons and explosives. Physical training was also important, which involved long-distance runs, climbing, stealth methods of walking and swimming. A certain degree of knowledge regarding common professions was also required if one was expected to take their form in disguise. Some evidence of medical training can be derived from one account, where an Iga ninja provided first-aid to Ii Naomasa, who was injured by gunfire in the Battle of Sekigahara. Here the ninja reportedly gave Naomasa a \"black medicine\" meant to stop bleeding.\\nWith the fall of the Iga and Kōga clans, daimyōs could no longer recruit professional ninja, and were forced to train their own shinobi. The shinobi was considered a real profession, as demonstrated in the 1649 bakufu law on military service, which declared that only daimyōs with an income of over 10,000 koku were allowed to retain shinobi. In the two centuries that followed, a number of ninjutsu manuals were written by descendants of Hattori Hanzō as well as members of the Fujibayashi clan, an offshoot of the Hattori. Major examples include the Ninpiden (1655), the Bansenshūkai (1675), and the Shōninki (1681).\\nModern schools that claim to train ninjutsu arose from the 1970s, including that of Masaaki Hatsumi (Bujinkan), Stephen K. Hayes (To-Shin Do), and Jinichi Kawakami (Banke Shinobinoden). The lineage and authenticity of these schools are a matter of controversy. \\n=== Tactics ===\\nThe ninja did not always work alone. Teamwork techniques exist: For example, in order to scale a wall, a group of ninja may carry each other on their backs, or provide a human platform to assist an individual in reaching greater heights. The Mikawa Go Fudoki gives an account where a coordinated team of attackers used passwords to communicate. The account also gives a case of deception, where the attackers dressed in the same clothes as the defenders, causing much confusion. When a retreat was needed during the Siege of Osaka, ninja were commanded to fire upon friendly troops from behind, causing the troops to charge backwards to attack a perceived enemy. This tactic was used again later on as a method of crowd dispersal.\\nMost ninjutsu techniques recorded in scrolls and manuals revolve around ways to avoid detection, and methods of escape. These techniques were loosely grouped under corresponding natural elements. Some examples are: Hitsuke: The practice of distracting guards by starting a fire away from the ninja\\'s planned point of entry. Falls under \"fire techniques\" (katon-no-jutsu).\\nTanuki-gakure: The practice of climbing a tree and camouflaging oneself within the foliage. Falls under \"wood techniques\" (mokuton-no-jutsu).\\nUkigusa-gakure: The practice of throwing duckweed over water to conceal underwater movement. Falls under \"water techniques\" (suiton-no-jutsu).\\nUzura-gakure: The practice of curling into a ball and remaining motionless to appear like a stone. Falls under \"earth techniques\" (doton-no-jutsu). \\n=== Disguises ===\\nThe use of disguises is common and well documented. Disguises came in the form of priests, entertainers, fortune tellers, merchants, rōnin, and monks. The Buke Myōmokushō states, Shinobi-monomi were people used in secret ways, and their duties were to go into the mountains and disguise themselves as firewood gatherers to discover and acquire the news about an enemy\\'s territory... they were particularly expert at travelling in disguise. A mountain ascetic\\'s (yamabushi) attire facilitated travel, as they were common and could travel freely between political boundaries. The loose robes of Buddhist priests also allowed concealed weapons, such as the tantō. Minstrel or sarugaku outfits could have allowed the ninja to spy in enemy buildings without rousing suspicion. Disguises as a komusō, a mendicant monk known for playing the shakuhachi, were also effective, as the large \"basket\" hats traditionally worn by them concealed the head completely. \\n== Equipment ==\\nNinja used a large variety of tools and weaponry, some of which were commonly known, but others were more specialized. Most were tools used in the infiltration of castles. A wide range of specialized equipment is described and illustrated in the 17th-century Bansenshūkai, including climbing equipment, extending spears, rocket-propelled arrows, and small collapsible boats. \\n=== Outerwear === While the image of a ninja clad in black garb (shinobi shōzoku) is prevalent in popular media, there is no hard evidence for such attire. It is theorized that, instead, it was much more common for the ninja to be disguised as civilians. The popular notion of black clothing may be rooted in artistic convention; early drawings of ninja showed them dressed in black to portray a sense of invisibility. This convention may have been borrowed from the puppet handlers of bunraku theater, who dressed in total black in an effort to simulate props moving independently of their controls. However, it has been put forward by some authorities that black robes, perhaps slightly tainted with red to hide bloodstains, was indeed the sensible garment of choice for infiltration.\\nClothing used was similar to that of the samurai, but loose garments (such as leggings) were tucked into trousers or secured with belts. The tenugui, a piece of cloth also used in martial arts, had many functions. It could be used to cover the face, form a belt, or assist in climbing.\\nThe historicity of armor specifically made for ninja cannot be ascertained. While pieces of light armor purportedly worn by ninja exist and date to the right time, there is no hard evidence of their use in ninja operations. Depictions of famous persons later deemed ninja often show them in samurai armor. There were lightweight concealable types of armour made with kusari (chain armour) and small armor plates such as karuta that could have been worn by ninja including katabira (jackets) made with armour hidden between layers of cloth. Shin and arm guards, along with metal-reinforced hoods are also speculated to make up the ninja\\'s armor. \\n=== Tools === Tools used for infiltration and espionage are some of the most abundant artifacts related to the ninja. Ropes and grappling hooks were common, and were tied to the belt. A collapsible ladder is illustrated in the Bansenshukai, featuring spikes at both ends to anchor the ladder. Spiked or hooked climbing gear worn on the hands and feet also doubled as weapons. Other implements include chisels, hammers, drills, picks, and so forth.\\nThe kunai was a heavy pointed tool, possibly derived from the Japanese masonry trowel, which it closely resembles. Although it is often portrayed in popular culture as a weapon, the kunai was primarily used for gouging holes in walls. Knives and small saws (hamagari) were also used to create holes in buildings, where they served as a foothold or a passage of entry. A portable listening device (saoto hikigane) was used to eavesdrop on conversations and detect sounds.\\nA line reel device known as a Toihikinawa (間引縄 / probing pulling rope) was used in pitch dark for finding the distance and route of entry.\\nThe mizugumo was a set of wooden shoes supposedly allowing the ninja to walk on water. They were meant to work by distributing the wearer\\'s weight over the shoes\\' wide bottom surface. The word mizugumo is derived from the native name for the Japanese water spider (Argyroneta aquatica japonica). The mizugumo was featured on the show MythBusters, where it was demonstrated unfit for walking on water. The ukidari, a similar footwear for walking on water, also existed in the form of a flat round bucket, but was probably quite unstable. Inflatable skins and breathing tubes allowed the ninja to stay underwater for longer periods of time.\\nGoshiki-mai (go, five; shiki, color; mai, rice) colored (red, blue, yellow, black, purple) rice grains were used in a code system, and to make trails that could be followed later.\\nDespite the large array of tools available to the ninja, the Bansenshukai warns one not to be overburdened with equipment, stating \"a successful ninja is one who uses but one tool for multiple tasks\". \\n=== Weaponry ===\\nAlthough shorter swords and daggers were used, the katana was probably the ninja\\'s weapon of choice, and was sometimes carried on the back. The katana had several uses beyond normal combat. In dark places, the scabbard could be extended out of the sword, and used as a long probing device. The sword could also be laid against the wall, where the ninja could use the sword guard (tsuba) to gain a higher foothold. The katana could even be used as a device to stun enemies before attacking them, by putting a combination of red pepper, dirt or dust, and iron filings into the area near the top of the scabbard, so that as the sword was drawn the concoction would fly into the enemy\\'s eyes, stunning him until a lethal blow could be made. While straight swords were used before the invention of the katana, there\\'s no known historical information about the straight ninjatō pre-20th century. The first photograph of a ninjatō appeared in a booklet by Heishichirō Okuse in 1956. A replica of a ninjatō is on display at the Ninja Museum of Igaryu. An array of darts, spikes, knives, and sharp, star-shaped discs were known collectively as shuriken. While not exclusive to the ninja, they were an important part of the arsenal, where they could be thrown in any direction. Bows were used for sharpshooting, and some ninjas\\' bows were intentionally made smaller than the traditional yumi (longbow). The chain and sickle (kusarigama) was also used by the ninja. This weapon consisted of a weight on one end of a chain, and a sickle (kama) on the other. The weight was swung to injure or disable an opponent, and the sickle used to kill at close range.\\nExplosives introduced from China were known in Japan by the time of the Mongol Invasions in the 13th century. Later, explosives such as hand-held bombs and grenades were adopted by the ninja. Soft-cased bombs were designed to release smoke or poison gas, along with fragmentation explosives packed with iron or ceramic shrapnel.\\nAlong with common shinobi buki (ninja weapons), a large assortment of miscellaneous arms were associated with the ninja.Some examples include poison, makibishi (caltrops), shikomizue (cane swords), land mines, fukiya (blowguns), poisoned darts, acid-spurting tubes, and teppo jutsu (firearms). The happō, a small eggshell filled with metsubushi (blinding powder), was also used to facilitate escape. \\n== Legendary abilities ==\\nSuperhuman or supernatural powers were often associated with the ninja with a style of Japanese martial arts in ninjutsu. Some legends include flight, invisibility, shapeshifting, teleportation, the ability to \"split\" into multiple bodies (bunshin), the summoning of animals (kuchiyose), and control over the five classical elements. Others included intangibility letting them walk through walls and often combined with invisibility, being roughly 7 imperial feet tall, having three heads, or being ghosts or a type of evil spirit. These fabulous notions have stemmed from popular imagination regarding the ninja\\'s mysterious status, as well as romantic ideas found in later Japanese art of the Edo period. The concept of the ninjas\\' magical powers were rooted in some ninjas\\' own disinformation efforts to disseminate fanciful information and their own folklore which leaked into the wider populace and became unintentional misinformation. For example, Nakagawa Shoshunjin, the 17th-century founder of Nakagawa-ryū, claimed in his own writings (Okufuji Monogatari) that he had the ability to transform into birds and animals.\\nLegendary elemental manipulation abilities may be grounded in real tactics, which were categorized by association with forces of nature. For example, the practice of starting fires to cover a ninja\\'s trail falls under katon-no-jutsu (\"fire techniques\"). By dressing in identical clothing, a coordinated team of ninjas could instill the perception of a single assailant being in multiple locations. The ninja\\'s adaption of kites in espionage and warfare is another subject of legends. Accounts exist of ninja being lifted into the air by kites, where they flew over hostile terrain and descended into, or dropped bombs on enemy territory. Kites were indeed used in Japanese warfare, but mostly for the purpose of sending messages and relaying signals. Turnbull suggests that kites lifting a man into midair might have been technically feasible, but states that the use of kites to form a human \"hang glider\" falls squarely in the realm of fantasy. \\n=== Kuji-kiri ===\\nKuji-kiri is an esoteric practice which, when performed with an array of hand \"seals\" (kuji-in), was meant to allow the ninja to enact superhuman feats.\\nThe kuji (\"nine characters\") is a concept originating from Taoism, where it was a string of nine words used in charms and incantations. In China, this tradition mixed with Buddhist beliefs, assigning each of the nine words to a Buddhist deity. The kuji may have arrived in Japan via Buddhism, where it flourished within Shugendō. Here too, each word in the kuji was associated with Buddhist deities, animals from Taoist mythology, and later, Shinto kami. The mudrā, a series of hand symbols representing different Buddhas, was applied to the kuji by Buddhists, possibly through the esoteric Mikkyō teachings. The yamabushi ascetics of Shugendō adopted this practice, using the hand gestures in spiritual, healing, and exorcism rituals. Later, the use of kuji passed onto certain bujutsu (martial arts) and ninjutsu schools, where it was said to have many purposes. The application of kuji to produce a desired effect was called \"cutting\" (kiri) the kuji. Intended effects range from physical and mental concentration, to more incredible claims about rendering an opponent immobile, or even the casting of magical spells. These legends were captured in popular culture, which interpreted the kuji-kiri as a precursor to magical acts. \\n== Foreign ninja ==\\nOn February 25, 2018, Yamada Yūji, the professor of Mie University and historian Nakanishi Gō announced that they had identified three people who were successful in early modern Ureshino, including the ninja Benkei Musō (弁慶夢想). Musō is thought to be the same person as Denrinbō Raikei (伝林坊頼慶), the Chinese disciple of Marume Nagayoshi, and possibly a pseudonym. \\n== Famous people ==\\nMany famous people in Japanese history have been associated or identified as ninja, but their status as ninja is difficult to prove and may be the product of later imagination. Rumors surrounding famous warriors, such as Kusunoki Masashige or Minamoto no Yoshitsune sometimes describe them as ninja, but there is little evidence for these claims.\\nSome well known examples include: Kumawakamaru (13th–14th centuries): a youth whose exiled father was ordered to death by the monk Homma Saburō. Kumakawa took his revenge by sneaking into Homma\\'s room while he was asleep, and assassinating him with his own sword. He was son of a high counselor to Emperor Go-Daigo, not ninja. The yamabushi Daizenboh who helped Kumawakamaru\\'s revenge was Suppa, a kind of ninja.\\nKumawaka (the 16th century): a suppa (ninja) who served Obu Toramasa (1504– 1565), a vassal of Takeda Shingen.\\nYagyū Munetoshi (1529–1606): a renowned swordsman of the Shinkage-ryū school. Muneyoshi\\'s grandson, Jubei Muneyoshi, told tales of his grandfather\\'s status as a ninja.\\nHattori Hanzō (1542–1596): a samurai serving under Tokugawa Ieyasu. His ancestry in Iga province, along with ninjutsu manuals published by his descendants have led some sources to define him as a ninja. This depiction is also common in popular culture.\\nIshikawa Goemon (1558–1594): Goemon reputedly tried to drip poison from a thread into Oda Nobunaga\\'s mouth through a hiding spot in the ceiling, but many fanciful tales exist about Goemon, and this story cannot be confirmed.\\nFūma Kotarō (d. 1603): a ninja rumored to have killed Hattori Hanzō, with whom he was supposedly rivals. The fictional weapon Fūma shuriken is named after him.\\nMochizuki Chiyome (16th century): the wife of Mochizuke Moritoki. Chiyome created a school for girls, which taught skills required of geisha, as well as espionage skills.\\nMomochi Sandayū (16th century): a leader of the Iga ninja clans, who supposedly perished during Oda Nobunaga\\'s attack on Iga province. There is some belief that he escaped death and lived as a farmer in Kii Province. Momochi is also a branch of the Hattori clan.\\nFujibayashi Nagato (16th century): considered to be one of three \"greatest\" Iga jōnin, the other two being Hattori Hanzō and Momochi Sandayū. Fujibayashi\\'s descendants wrote and edited the Bansenshukai.\\nKatō Danzō (1503–1569): a famed 16th-century ninja master during the Sengoku period who was also known as \"Flying Katō\".\\nTateoka Doshun (16th century): a purported Iga ninja during the Sengoku period.\\nKarasawa Genba (16th century): a samurai of the Sengoku period, in the 16th century of the common era, who served as an important retainer of the Sanada clan.\\nWada Koremasa (1536–1571): a powerful Kōka samurai ninja who in 1568 allied with the Ashikaga shogunate and Oda Nobunaga, at which point he relocated to Settsu Province.\\nShimotsuge no Kizaru (16th century): an influential Iga ninja who in 1560 successfully led an attack on Tōichi Castle.\\nTakino Jurobei (16th century): The commander of some of the final resistance against Oda Nobunaga in his invasion of Iga. Momochi Sandayu, Fujibayashi Nagato no Kami, and Hattori Hanzō served as his officers. \\n== In popular culture == The image of the ninja entered popular culture in the Edo period, when folktales and plays about ninja were conceived. Stories about the ninja are usually based on historical figures. For instance, many similar tales exist about a daimyō challenging a ninja to prove his worth, usually by stealing his pillow or weapon while he slept. Novels were written about the ninja, such as Jiraiya Gōketsu Monogatari, which was also made into a kabuki play. Fictional figures such as Sarutobi Sasuke would eventually make their way into comics and television, where they have come to enjoy a culture hero status outside their original mediums.\\nNinja appear in many forms of Japanese and Western popular media, including books (Kōga Ninpōchō), movies (Enter the Ninja, Revenge of the Ninja, Ninja Assassin), television (Akakage, The Master, Ninja Warrior), video games (Shinobi, Ninja Gaiden, Tenchu, Sekiro, Ghost of Tsushima), anime (Naruto, Ninja Scroll, Gatchaman), manga (Basilisk, Ninja Hattori-kun, Azumi), Western animation (Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu) and American comic books (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). From ancient Japan to the modern world media, popular depictions range from the realistic to the fantastically exaggerated, both fundamentally and aesthetically. \\n== Gallery == \\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t \\n== See also == Kunoichi\\nModern schools of ninjutsu\\nNinja Museum of Igaryu\\nKhevtuul\\nOrder of Assassins\\nOrder of Musashi Shinobi Samurai\\nPre-modern special forces\\nSicarii \\n== References == \\n=== Citations === \\n=== Sources === \\n=== Further reading === \\n== External links ==\\nBansenshukai\\nSamurai and Ninja\\nNinja magazine\\n Media related to Ninja at Wikimedia Commons',\n",
       " 'Kakashi_Hatake': 'Kakashi Hatake (Japanese: はたけ カカシ, Hepburn: Hatake Kakashi) is a fictional character and one of the main protagonists in the Naruto manga and anime series created by Masashi Kishimoto. In the story, Kakashi is the teacher of Team 7, consisting of the series\\' primary characters, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, and Sakura Haruno.  Kakashi\\'s past has been extensively explored in the series, resulting in a gaiden being devoted to his past experiences. Kakashi has appeared in several pieces of Naruto media, the featured films in the series, the original video animations, and the video games.\\nKakashi is depicted in Naruto as an eccentric but highly skilled shinobi for the Hidden Leaf Village. Initially cold and calculated due to the suicide of his father, Sakumo, Kakashi eventually began to warm up in his youth with the help of his teammate Obito Uchiha, while they are under the tutelage of Naruto\\'s father Minato Namikaze. It is through Obito that Kakashi obtains the Uchiha clan\\'s Sharingan (which originally only contained 1 tomoe), which he uses to copy the abilities of his opponents and make his own, but also drains his energy. Following the deaths of all of his squadmates, unaware of Obito\\'s survival, Kakashi is eventually given charge of Team 7 due to his connections with Minato and the Uchiha, and through them is able to finally have the family he never had. He is initially portrayed as a detached and apathetic figure, but as the series progresses, his loyalty to his friends, students, and the village becomes increasingly apparent.\\nKakashi was originally created by Kishimoto to be a harsh teacher but the author decided to avoid that. Instead, he made him more generous to calm his students in difficult situations to the point of giving him feminine traits. Kakashi\\'s design gave Kishimoto difficulties as a result of having most of his face covered and as a result it was difficult to show his emotions. For the anime series, he is voiced by Kazuhiko Inoue in Japanese and Dave Wittenberg in the English dub.\\nNumerous anime and manga publications have praised and criticized Kakashi\\'s character. Although he has been noted to be an echo of similar detached shōnen manga characters, the duality of Kakashi\\'s apathetic and serious sides have been praised. Kakashi has been highly popular with the Naruto reader base, placing high in several popularity polls. Merchandise based on Kakashi has also been released, including key chains and plush dolls. \\n== Creation ==\\nMasashi Kishimoto originally intended for Kakashi to debut in the second chapter of the Naruto manga, appearing prior to the other members of Team 7. This Kakashi was designed as a laid back but very skilled ninja that ended his sentences with the polite \"de gozaru\" in the Japanese versions of the series. After speaking with his editor, Kishimoto pushed this debut back, allowing him to better develop Kakashi and the rest of Team 7. Despite this, Kakashi retains many of his original personality traits, being easygoing, unfazed by the actions of others, and eyes appearing to be half-asleep. Kishimoto feels that this makes Kakashi a compelling leader and helps to keep the diverse members of Team 7 unified. Early in the making of the series, Kakashi was designed as a samurai but he was not sure what the character would do in the manga. Thinking about how the protagonists\\' teacher would behave, Kishimoto envisioned him as a rude adult. However, he was not happy with this type of personality so he rewrote it to a more laid back person. He found this portrayal funny but still made him hot-blooded for serious situations. As the manga continued, he changed his speech pattern and gave it a laid back touch, with kindness and a woman-like. There was no model for Kakashi; Kishimoto wanted to write a calm teacher who would help his students in complicated situations.\\nBecause he acts as a link between the other main characters of the series, Kakashi is rarely featured prominently in promotional artwork, instead appearing in the background while his students are the focus. In an interview in Shōnen Jump\\'s, Kishimoto said that if he were to make an extra story from the manga with a different character, such character would be Kakashi. In early 2014, Kishimoto commented he wanted to reveal Kakashi\\'s face but was not sure whether it would be in the manga or an upcoming movie. The Raikiri, one of Kakashi\\'s most common techniques, had a different name, but the author forgot it. Nevertheless, he found the name Raikiri fitting for this lightning-based technique. Kakashi\\'s Sharingan (写輪眼, lit. \"Copy Wheel Eye\", English manga: \"Mirror Wheel Eye\") was introduced to give the character mystery as only members from the Uchiha clan could possess it. By chapter 16 of the manga, Kishimoto had already decided how Kakashi obtained the Sharingan. He also added that Kakashi\\'s face was difficult to draw since it is covered by a mask. In April 2015, Kishimoto revealed Kakashi\\'s face for the first time during an exhibition.\\nWhen deciding upon Kakashi\\'s name, Kishimoto considered a number of possibilities: Kuwa (クワ, \"hoe\"), Kama (カマ, \"scythe\"), Botan (ボタン, \"peony\"), Enoki (エノキ, a nettle tree), and Kakashi (カカシ, \"scarecrow\"). He eventually decided upon Kakashi, and remains glad that he did to this day. In keeping with the meaning of his name, scarecrows are occasionally used to represent Kakashi; Naruto, for example, uses a scarecrow that is dressed like Kakashi to help him train for a combat test between the two. Likewise, scarecrows are at times added to the background of scenes in which Kakashi appears, as is the case with the cover of the Naruto manga volume three.\\nIn animated versions of the manga, Kakashi has been voiced by Kazuhiko Inoue in Japanese. Inoue was surprised about Kakashi\\'s popularity within the Naruto fans and expected people to continue supporting him. In an interview, Dave Wittenberg, who does the voice acting for Kakashi in the English dub, comments that he feels he is similar to the character since he tends to have one eye open at a time and he becomes angry if he is interrupted while reading. He also added that what he likes most about Kakashi is his relation with his students, noting him to be \"a very nice person\". \\n== Appearances == \\n=== In Naruto ===\\n \\nKakashi Hatake is introduced as the Jonin (elite ninja) leader in charge of Team 7, a new ninja team including Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. He first appears as a carefree character and tends to lose track of time, being frequently late to his appointments as a result. However, when testing his students, Kakashi reveals himself as a strong opponent to the point of fighting while reading Make Out (イチャイチャ, Icha Icha) series of erotic novels. Kakashi is renowned throughout the Naruto world for the use of his Sharingan, which he received from his teammate Obito Uchiha, and is revered as the ninja who has copied over a thousand jutsus, earning him the moniker \"Copy Ninja Kakashi\" (コピー忍者のカカシ, Kopī Ninja no Kakashi) and \"Kakashi of the Sharingan\" (写輪眼のカカシ, Sharingan no Kakashi). The Sharingan grants him the ability to mimic the movements and jutsu of others. Although most of Kakashi\\'s abilities were acquired with his Sharingan, he also invented the Chidori (千鳥, lit. \"One Thousand Birds\") and its Lightning Blade variation, a collection of lightning chakra in one\\'s hand that uses the Sharingan\\'s visual ability to lock onto a target. When first forming Team 7, Kakashi does not take them as his students until instilling in them the concept of teamwork even if they have to break the rules he gave them. Kakashi continues to further this philosophy for the duration of Part I upon Sasuke Uchiha but is unable to get through to him before the latter\\'s defection from Konoha. Kakashi also reluctantly participates in various challenges by his childhood friend Might Guy who considers Kakashi his rival.\\nKakashi\\'s background is explored in Kakashi Gaiden, a six chapter series that divides the gap between Part I and II of the manga. Kakashi is the son of Sakumo Hatake, one of the most powerful shinobi Konoha ever produced, renowned throughout the ninja world as \"White Fang of the Leaf\". Kakashi was himself a child prodigy and, during the ninja academy years, was hailed as the best of his generation. Following his father\\'s suicide after a failed mission, Kakashi adopted the philosophy that the success of a mission must always come first, over the welfare of his comrades. Kakashi is assigned by his teacher, Minato Namikaze, to lead a mission that would turn the current war in Konoha\\'s favor. When his teammate, Rin Nohara, is captured by enemy ninja, his other teammate, Obito Uchiha, convinces him to rescue her. After finding Rin, an enemy-induced cave-in crushed Obito\\'s right half. As his dying wish, Obito has Rin implant his newly acquired Sharingan into Kakashi\\'s freshly damaged eye socket as a parting gift. His new eye in place, Kakashi flees with Rin as the cave collapses, completing their mission. Shortly after this event, Kakashi has to rescue Rin, who is kidnapped by Kirigakure, again; however, he learns that the Kiri, under the influence of Madara Uchiha, have made Rin the host of the Three Tails, Isobu. Rin requests Kakashi kill her so she may not be used as part of a Trojan Horse scheme against Konoha, but Kakashi is reluctant. She eventually forces herself on the way of Kakashi\\'s Lightning Blade that he originally directed at the pursuing Hidden Mist ninja, killing her. An anime exclusive flashback arc in Naruto Shippuden covered Kakashi coping with what he endured during the war as he becomes an ANBU operative during Minato\\'s time as Hokage and influences Yamato into becoming a member of the ANBU as well. Once relieved of duty in the ANBU, Kakashi becomes a Genin instructor prior to the events of Part I. Two-and-a-half years later in Part II, Kakashi reforms Team 7, with new arrival Sai in Sasuke\\'s place. During the gap in time, Kakashi hones the Mangekyo Sharingan (万華鏡写輪眼, Mangekyō Sharingan, lit. \"Kaleidoscope Copy Wheel Eye\") gained from Rin\\'s death to master the Kamui ability that allows him to send any targeted object to another dimension. Because his students are now capable of taking care of themselves, Kakashi takes a more active role in battles, particularly those with the criminal organization Akatsuki. When the Akatsuki leader, Pain, invades Konoha, Kakashi engages him in battle, and dies from exhausting all his energy. However, after his confrontation with Naruto, Pain decides to use all of his remaining power to revive all those killed in the battle at Konoha, including Kakashi. Following a brief encounter with Tobi, the Akatsuki\\'s true leader, Kakashi becomes one of the generals to participate in the war against Tobi\\'s army. As Naruto and Killer Bee continue to battle against Tobi and his forces, Kakashi and Guy arrive to join the fight. During the encounter, Kakashi learns that Tobi is Obito, who in fact had survived his apparent death and had committed to destroying the world order that allowed their friend\\'s demise; Kakashi is left greatly stunned and horrified at Obito\\'s actions. Despite the guilt for what Obito has become, Kakashi is encouraged by Naruto to continue fighting and the battle ends with Kakashi impaling Obito. When Naruto is nearly killed by Madara, Kakashi and a redeemed Obito join forces to protect Naruto by spiriting him off into the latter\\'s dimension to be healed. After Kakashi loses his Sharingan, Naruto uses his new-found abilities to restore his original eye. Kakashi finds himself temporarily infused by the chakra-based spirit of Obito as he gains his friend\\'s full Sharingan abilities and a Susanoo to help his team defeat Kaguya. Kakashi Hatake is the commander of the third battle unit in fourth great ninja war. Following the conclusion of the war, Kakashi is named by Tsunade as her successor, the Sixth Hokage, with his first act being to pardon Sasuke for his crimes. He holds this title for many years before finally passing it to Naruto, as revealed in the epilogue. \\n=== Appearances in other media ===\\nKakashi has made appearances outside of the Naruto anime and manga. He is in ten of the feature films in the series: in the first movie he battles Nadare Rouga and later defeats him, in the third Kakashi battles the hired ninja Ishidate, whom he fights to a standstill, and he later acts as a distraction for his team by battling the minister Shabadaba\\'s soldiers, in the fourth Kakashi fights against a large group of stone soldiers, in the fifth, Kakashi is sent alongside Shikamaru Nara, Sai, and Shino Aburame to investigate the base of the Sky Country, in the sixth, when the threat of war loom over Konoha from the other ninja villages, Kakashi is sent on a suicide mission to defeat a rogue ninja named Hiruko who wants his Sharingan, however, Naruto and Sakura ultimately prevent their teacher from throwing his life away, in the seventh movie, in which a younger Kakashi is a member of a team composed of himself, Minato, Shibi Aburame and Chōza Akimichi to stop Anrokuzan with the help of a time displaced Naruto. In the eighth, he serves as part of the plan to lock Naruto in prison before subsequently helping to break him out, and in the ninth, an alternate version of him with an identical appearance to Guy is shown, to Sakura\\'s dismay. Canonically, in the tenth, he appears as the Sixth Hokage, helping the village while Naruto is away, and in the eleventh he makes a cameo appearance waking up a drowsy Naruto (who is now the Seventh Hokage) shadow clone by tapping him on the head with a book.\\nKakashi is also present in all four of the original video animations produced for the series, helping Naruto and Konohamaru Sarutobi to find a four leaf clover in the first original video animation, joining his team in escorting a ninja named Shibuki to his village in the second, participating in a tournament in the third, and working with Team 7 in the fourth one. A light novel titled Kakashi Hiden: Lightning in the Icy Sky, written by Akira Higashiyama and illustrated by Kishimoto, focuses on the early days of Kakashi\\'s appointment as the Sixth Hokage, in which he has to stop a terror plan conducted by a pair of Kirigakure ninja, who plan to take control of a newly unveiled airborne ship to stage a jailbreak of a notorious criminal, in the process learning about the pair\\'s tragic reason for doing so. In the anime sequel of Naruto Shippuden, Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Kakashi makes minor appearances until testing the young main characters during a test to see if they can become ninjas.\\nKakashi is a playable character in all Naruto video games, including the Clash of Ninja series and the Ultimate Ninja series. In some games, he is able to use his Sharingan in combat, often as a different character with the ability activated, and in other games, he is available in his ANBU attire. An upcoming light novel titled Kakashi Hiden will focus on the character. \\n== Reception ==\\nKakashi has ranked within the top five characters in every official Weekly Shōnen Jump popularity poll, acquiring the first position, as the most popular character, several times. In the most recent poll, he ranked third, with Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha acquiring the top two positions. In the Anime Awards 2006 from About.com, Kakashi won in the category \"Best Supporting Male Character\". He was also a nominee during the first \"Nickelodeon Magazine Comics Awards\" in the category \"Best Hair in Comics\", losing to Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes. In an Oricon poll of \"manga master\", Kakashi was third with 8.4% of the votes. Merchandise based on Kakashi\\'s character has also been released, including plush dolls, key chains, and a limited edition figurine.\\nSeveral publications for manga, anime, video games, and other related media have provided praise and criticism on Kakashi\\'s character. Christopher A. Born regards Kakashi\\'s teaching of Team 7 to work as a team, even if they have to break the rules, to be reinforcing the Confucian values of the \"importance of benevolence and reciprocity\". IGN noted the duality of Kakashi\\'s serious persona in combat and his laid back, apathetic countenance when dealing with his students, but accepted that he is one of the most popular characters in the series. They also commented that Kakashi is one of the more popular characters they have seen cosplayed at anime conventions. Active Anime celebrated Kakashi\\'s abilities, noting that he fell into the overall theme of characters hiding detailed personalities and secrets. T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews derided Kakashi as a stereotypical \"Man of Mystery\" seen in other shōnen manga, but praised him as being \"much more interesting\" than the three main characters, and felt that for all intents and purposes, the show could be renamed simply \"Kakashi\". Mania Entertainment\\'s Dani Moure likes how Kakashi fits into Team 7 because he is a \"hilarious character in that sometimes he doesn\\'t seem all that bothered about things and yet is so masterful of his craft.\" Chris Beveridge from the site stated that Kakashi is his favorite character from the series because of his personality and praised his fight against Pain, and that after its ending, the character gets \"a very humanizing moment\", making the episode from the battle stand out. Manga author Yoshihiro Togashi found Kakashi\\'s first battle against his students as one of the first series\\' moments that impressed him due to how the difference in strength between them was shown by just making Kakashi read a book during the fight. IGN ranked him as the 15th greatest anime character of all time, saying that \"He\\'s a complex character, with an iconic character design and a laid back attitude that just exudes cool.\" Amy McNulty from Anime News Network highly praised Kakashi\\'s fight against Obito Uchiha due to its animation and the references to the two fighters\\' childhoods. In 2014, IGN listed him as the best Naruto character when the series ended.\\nKakashi\\'s portrayal in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations attracted negative responses by Anime News Network. His rude demeanor during the ninja graduation exams was criticized as the reviewer noted Boruto did not deserve such poor treatment. In a latter review, ANN criticized the poor advice he gives to Sasuke when his former student is trying to bond with his daughter, Sarada Uchiha, making it unsuitable comic relief. \\n== References == \\n== External links ==  Media related to Kakashi Hatake at Wikimedia Commons',\n",
       " 'Naruto': 'Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts: the first is set in Naruto\\'s pre-teen years (volumes 1–27), and the second in his teens (volumes 28–72). The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha\\'s monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).\\nNaruto was serialized in Shueisha\\'s shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from September 1999 to November 2014, with its chapters collected in 72 tankōbon volumes. Viz Media licensed the manga for North American production and serialized Naruto in their digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. Part I of the manga was adapted into an anime television series by Pierrot and Aniplex, which ran for 220 episodes from October 2002 to February 2007 on TV Tokyo. A second series, which adapts material from Part II of the manga, is titled Naruto: Shippuden and ran on TV Tokyo for 500 episodes from February 2007 to March 2017. Pierrot also developed 11 animated films and 12 original video animations (OVAs). The franchise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards developed by several companies. The story of Naruto continues in Boruto, where Naruto\\'s son Boruto Uzumaki creates his own ninja way instead of following his father\\'s.\\nNaruto is one of the best-selling manga series of all time, having 250 million copies in circulation worldwide in 47 countries and regions, with 153 million copies in Japan alone and remaining 97 million copies elsewhere. It has become one of Viz Media\\'s best-selling manga series; their English translations of the volumes have appeared on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller list several times, and the seventh volume won a Quill Award in 2006. Reviewers praised the manga\\'s character development, storylines, and action sequences, though some felt the latter slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga, which has a coming-of-age theme, makes use of cultural references from Japanese mythology and Confucianism. \\n== Plot == \\n=== Part I === A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire, one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze, at the cost of his life, seals the fox inside the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, making him a host of the beast. The Third Hokage returns from retirement to become the leader of Konoha again. Naruto is often scorned by Konoha\\'s villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Due to a decree by the Third Hokage forbidding any mention of these events, Naruto learns nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to him. Naruto defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the respect of his teacher, Iruka Umino.\\nShortly afterward, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with Sasuke Uchiha, against whom he often competes, and Sakura Haruno, on whom he has a crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced sensei, the elite ninja Kakashi Hatake. Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7 completes missions requested by the villagers, ranging from doing chores and being bodyguards to performing assassinations.\\nAfter several missions, including a major one in the Land of Waves, Kakashi allows Team 7 to take a ninja exam, enabling them to advance to a higher rank and take on more difficult missions, known as Chunin Exams. During the exams, Orochimaru, a wanted criminal, invades Konoha and kills the Third Hokage for revenge. Jiraiya, one of the three legendary ninjas, declines the title of Fifth Hokage and searches with Naruto for Tsunade whom he chooses to become Fifth Hokage instead.\\nDuring the search, it is revealed that Orochimaru wishes to train Sasuke because of his powerful genetic heritage, the Sharingan. After Sasuke attempts and fails to kill his older brother Itachi, who had showed up in Konoha to kidnap Naruto, he joins Orochimaru, hoping to gain from him the strength needed to kill Itachi. The story takes a turn when Sasuke leaves the village: Tsunade sends a group of ninja, including Naruto, to retrieve Sasuke, but Naruto is unable to persuade or force him to come back. Naruto and Sakura do not give up on Sasuke; Naruto leaves Konoha to receive training from Jiraiya to prepare himself for the next time he encounters Sasuke, while Sakura becomes Tsunade\\'s apprentice. \\n=== Part II === Two and a half years later, Naruto returns from his training with Jiraiya. The Akatsuki starts kidnapping the hosts of the powerful Tailed Beasts. Team 7 and other Leaf ninja fight against them and search for their teammate Sasuke. The Akatsuki succeeds in capturing and extracting seven of the Tailed Beasts, killing all the hosts except Gaara, who is now the Kazekage. Meanwhile, Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and faces Itachi to take revenge. After Itachi dies in battle, Sasuke learns from the Akatsuki founder Tobi that Itachi had been ordered by Konoha\\'s superiors to destroy his clan to prevent a coup; he accepted, on the condition that Sasuke would be spared. Devastated by this revelation, Sasuke joins the Akatsuki to destroy Konoha in revenge. As Konoha ninjas defeat several Akatsuki members, the Akatsuki figurehead leader, Nagato, kills Jiraiya and devastates Konoha, but Naruto defeats and redeems him, earning the village\\'s respect and admiration.\\nWith Nagato\\'s death, Tobi, disguised as Madara Uchiha (one of Konoha\\'s founding fathers), announces that he wants to capture all nine Tailed Beasts to cast an illusion powerful enough to control all humanity and achieve world peace. The leaders of the five ninja villages refuse to help him and instead join forces to confront his faction and allies. That decision results in a Fourth Shinobi World War between the combined armies of the Five Great Countries (known as the Allied Shinobi Forces) and Akatsuki\\'s forces of zombie-like ninjas. The Five Kage try to keep Naruto, unaware of the war, in a secret island turtle near Kumogakure (Hidden Cloud Village), but Naruto finds out and escapes from the island with Killer Bee, the host of the Eight-Tails. At that time, Naruto—along with the help of Killer Bee—gains control of his Tailed Beast and the two of them head for the battlefield.\\nDuring the conflict, it is revealed that Tobi is Obito Uchiha, a former teammate of Kakashi\\'s who was thought to be dead. The real Madara saved Obito\\'s life, and they have since collaborated. As Sasuke learns the history of Konoha, including the circumstances that led to his clan\\'s downfall, he decides to protect the village and rejoins Naruto and Sakura to thwart Madara and Obito\\'s plans. However, Madara\\'s body ends up possessed by Kaguya Otsutsuki, an ancient princess who intends to subdue all humanity. A reformed Obito sacrifices himself to help Team 7 stop her. Once Kaguya is sealed, Madara dies as well. Sasuke takes advantage of the situation and takes control of all the Tailed Beasts, as he reveals his goal of ending the current village system. Naruto confronts Sasuke to dissuade him from his plan, and after they almost kill each other in a final battle, Sasuke admits defeat and reforms. After the war, Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage and pardons Sasuke for his crimes. Years later, Kakashi steps down while Naruto marries Hinata Hyuga and becomes the Seventh Hokage, raising the next generation. \\n== Production == \\n=== Development ===\\nIn 1995, Shueisha released Karakuri, a one-shot manga by Masashi Kishimoto that earned an honorable mention in the Hop Step Award in 1996. Kishimoto was unsatisfied with his subsequent drafts for a follow-up, and decided to work on another project. The new project was originally going to feature Naruto as a chef, but this version never made it to print. Kishimoto originally wanted to make Naruto a child who could transform into a fox, so he created a one-shot of Naruto for the summer 1997 issue of Akamaru Jump based on the idea. Despite the positive feedback it received in a readers\\' poll, Kishimoto was unhappy with the art and the story, so he rewrote it as a story about ninjas.\\nThe first eight chapters of Naruto were planned before it appeared in Weekly Shōnen Jump, and these chapters originally devoted many panels of intricate art to illustrating the Konoha village. By the time Naruto debuted, the background art was sparse, instead emphasizing the characters. Though Kishimoto had concerns that chakra (the energy source used by the ninjas in Naruto) made the series too Japanese, he still believed it is an enjoyable read. Kishimoto is a fan of Godzilla, and the tailed beasts mythology was introduced because Kishimoto wanted an excuse to draw monsters. He has said that the central theme in Part I of Naruto is how people accept each other, citing Naruto\\'s development across the series as an example.\\nFor Part II of the manga, Kishimoto tried to keep the panel layouts and the plot easy for the reader to follow, and avoid \"overdo[ing] the typical manga-style\". He considers that his drawing style has changed from \"the classic manga look to something a bit more realistic.\" Because of wishing to end the arc involving Sasuke Uchiha\\'s search for his brother, Itachi, in a single volume, Kishimoto decided that volume 43 should include more chapters than regular volumes. As a result, Kishimoto apologized to readers for this since volume 43 was more expensive than regular volumes. \\n=== Characters === When he created Naruto, Kishimoto looked to other shōnen manga as influences for his work and tried to make his characters unique, while basing the story on Japanese culture. The separation of the characters into different teams was intended to give each group a particular flavor. Kishimoto wanted each member to have a high level of aptitude in one skill and be talentless in another. He found it difficult to write about romance, but emphasized it more in Part II of the manga, beginning with volume 28. He introduced villains into the story to have them act as a counterpoint to his characters\\' moral values and clearly illustrate their differences. As a result of how the younger characters were significantly weaker than the villains, Kishimoto made the ellipsis in order to have them age and become stronger during this time. \\n=== Setting ===\\nKishimoto made use of the Chinese zodiac tradition, which had a long-standing presence in Japan; the zodiac hand signs originate from this. When Kishimoto was creating the primary setting of the Naruto manga, he concentrated initially on the designs for the village of Konoha. The idea of the setting came to him \"pretty spontaneously without much thought\", but admits that the scenery became based on his home in the Japanese prefecture of Okayama. Since the storyline does not specify when it is set, he was able to include modern elements in the series such as convenience stores. He considered including automobiles, planes and simple computers, but excluded projectile weapons and vehicles from the plot. \\n=== Conclusion ===\\nMasashi Kishimoto\\'s home was close to Hiroshima where his grandfather lived. He would often tell his grandson stories of war and how it was related to grudges. In retrospect, Kishimoto commented he could not criticize anyone as a result of the war based on it was built. Upon further researching, Kishimoto decided to create world war story arc for the manga\\'s finale. However, unlike the stories he heard from his grandfather, Kishimoto wanted to give the war covered in Naruto a more hopeful feeling. Nagato\\'s arc paved the way for the ending of Naruto to occur. Nagato stood out as a villain due to suffering war and killing Naruto\\'s mentor Jiraiya. Understanding the fears of war, Naruto\\'s characterization was made more complex for him to experience the Fourth Great Shinobi War. These events end with Naruto forgiving Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato in the final battle. \\nDue to unknown issues, the series\\' finale was delayed. Once volume 66 was released, Kishimoto commented he reached a moment from the narrative involving something he always wanted to draw. When serialization began, Kishimoto decided the ending would feature a fight between two characters: Naruto and Sasuke. However, the writer felt the two were not equals as the former was not a victim of war like the latter whose family was killed to stop a possible civil war. \\nKishimoto chose Hinata Hyuga as Naruto\\'s romantic partner from the early stages of the manga, since Hinata had always respected and admired Naruto even before the series\\' beginning, and Kishimoto felt this meant the two of them could build a relationship. When Hinata first appeared, Kishimoto thought of expanding romantic plotlines. but decided to leave Naruto\\'s maturation through romance as an idea for the film 2014 The Last: Naruto the Movie where he worked alongside screenwriter Maruo Kyozuka, a writer more skilled at the theme of romance. Similarly, the title character\\'s relationship with his first son, Boruto, was explored furthermore in the 2015 film Boruto: Naruto the Movie to end Naruto\\'s growth as the character had become an adult, but it was briefly shown in the manga\\'s finale. \\n== Media == \\n=== Manga === Written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto, Naruto was serialized for a 15-year run in Shueisha\\'s magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from September 21, 1999, to November 10, 2014.

The first 238 chapters are Part I and constitute the first section of the Naruto storyline. Chapters 239 to 244 include a gaiden (side-story) focusing on Kakashi Hatake\\'s background. The remaining chapters (245 to 700) belong to Part II, which continues the story after a 2+1⁄2-year gap in the internal timeline. Shueisha have also released several ani-manga tankōbon, each based on one of the Naruto movies, and has released the series in Japanese for cell-phone download on their website Shueisha Manga Capsule.

The schedule was accelerated at the end of 2007 to catch up with the Japanese version, and again in early 2009, with 11 volumes (from 34 to 44) appearing in three months, after which it returned to a quarterly schedule. All 27 volumes of Part I were released in a boxed set on November 13, 2007.

It ran in Shueisha\\'s Saikyō Jump magazine from December 3, 2010, to July 4, 2014, and was made into an anime series, produced by Studio Pierrot, and premiering on TV Tokyo on April 3, 2012. Crunchyroll simulcasted the series\\' premiere on their website and streamed the following episodes. Taira also wrote Uchiha Sasuke no Sharingan Den, which released on October 3, 2014, which runs in the same magazine and features Sasuke.\\nA monthly sequel series titled Boruto: Naruto Next Generations began in the Japanese and English editions of Weekly Shōnen Jump in early 2016, illustrated by Mikio Ikemoto and written by Ukyō Kodachi, with supervision by Kishimoto. Ikemoto was Kishimoto\\'s chief assistant during the run of the original Naruto series, and Kodachi was his writing partner for the Boruto: Naruto the Movie film screenplay. The monthly series was preceded by a one-shot, titled Naruto: The Path Lit by the Full Moon (NARUTO-ナルト-外伝 ～満ちた月が照らす道～, Naruto Gaiden ~Michita Tsuki ga Terasu Michi~), written and illustrated by Kishimoto, and published on April 25 of that same year. The staff from Shueisha asked Kishimoto if he would write a sequel to Naruto. However, Kishimoto refused the offer and offered his former assistant Mikio Ikemoto and writer Ukyō Kodachi write Boruto: Naruto Next Generations as the sequel to Naruto.\\nAnother one-shot chapter by Kishimoto, titled Naruto: The Whorl Within the Spiral (NARUTO-ナルト-外伝 ～渦の中のつむじ風～, Naruto Gaiden ~Uzu no Naka no Tsumujikaze~), centered on Naruto\\'s father, Minato Namikaze, was published in Weekly Shōnen Jump on July 18, 2023. \\n=== Anime === The first Naruto anime television series, directed by Hayato Date and produced by Pierrot and Aniplex, premiered on TV Tokyo in Japan on October 3, 2002, and concluded on February 8, 2007, after 220 episodes. The first 135 episodes were adapted from Part I of the manga; the remaining 85 episodes are original and use plot elements that are not in the manga. Tetsuya Nishio was the character designer for Naruto when the manga was adapted into an anime; Kishimoto had requested that Nishio be given this role.\\nThe second anime television series, titled Naruto: Shippuden, was also produced by Pierrot and directed by Hayato Date, and serves as a direct sequel to the first Naruto anime series; it corresponds to Part II of the manga. It debuted on Japanese TV on February 15, 2007, on TV Tokyo, and concluded on March 23, 2017.\\nA series of four \"brand-new\" episodes, to commemorate the original anime\\'s 20th anniversary, were originally scheduled to premiere on September 3, 2023; however, in August of that same year, it was announced that the episodes would be postponed to a later date. \\n==== Films ==== The series was adapted into 11 theatrical films and 12 original video animations (OVAs). The first three films correspond to the first series, and the remaining eight correspond to the second. In July 2015, Lionsgate announced the development of a live-action film with Avi Arad through his production company Arad Productions. The film will be directed by Michael Gracey. On December 17, 2016, Kishimoto announced that he has been asked to co-develop.

The majority of them are fighting games in which the player directly controls one of the characters from Naruto. The player pits their character against another character controlled by the game\\'s AI or by another player; the objective is to reduce the opponent\\'s health to zero using basic attacks as well as special techniques unique to each character derived from techniques they use in the Naruto anime or manga. The first Naruto video game was Naruto: Konoha Ninpōchō, which was released in Japan on March 27, 2003, for the WonderSwan Color. Most Naruto video games have been released only in Japan. The first games released outside of Japan were the Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen series and the Naruto: Saikyou Ninja Daikesshu series, released in North America under the titles of Naruto: Clash of Ninja and Naruto: Ninja Council. In 2023, Namco Bandai announced that the Naruto video games had sold 32.52 million units worldwide. \\n=== Art and guidebooks === Three official artbooks based on the Naruto series have been released. The first two, titled Art Collection: Uzumaki, and Illustration Collection: Naruto, were released in Japan in 2004 and 2009, with North American editions following in 2007 and 2010 respectively. The third artbook Illustration Collection: Naruto Uzumaki, was published in 2015 in Japan and later the same year in North America; it contains artwork originally on Shonen Jump comic covers. It has no text except a brief commentary by Kishimoto about his favorite artworks. An interactive coloring book called Paint Jump: Art of Naruto was released in 2008. An unreleased artbook titled Naruto Exhibition Official Guest Book by Masashi Kishimoto was given to those who attended the Naruto art exhibition at the Mori Art Museum on April 25, 2015.\\nFour guidebooks titled First Official Data Book through Fourth Official Data Book have been released; the first two cover Part I of the manga, and were released in 2002 and 2005; the third and fourth volumes appeared in 2008 and 2014. These books contain character profiles, Jutsu guides, and drafts by Kishimoto. For the anime, a series of guidebooks called Naruto Anime Profiles was released. These books contain information about the production of the anime episodes and explanations of the characters\\' designs. A manga fan book titled Secret: Writings from the Warriors Official Fanbook appeared in 2002, and another fan book was released to commemorate the series\\' 10th anniversary, including illustrations of Naruto Uzumaki by other manga artists, a novel, Kishimoto\\'s one-shot titled Karakuri, and an interview between Kishimoto and Yoshihiro Togashi. \\n=== Collectible card game ===\\nProduced by Bandai, the Naruto Collectible Card Game was released in Japan in 2003, and in North America in 2006. The game is played between two players using a customized deck of fifty cards from the set, and a game mat. To win, a player must either earn ten \"battle rewards\" through their actions in the game or cause the other player to exhaust their deck.  The cards were released in named sets called \"series\", in the form of four 50-card pre-constructed box sets. Each set includes a starter deck, the game mat, a turn-counter, and one stainless steel \"Ninja Blade Coin\". Extra cards are available in 10-card booster packs, and deck sets. Four box sets sold in retailers are available for each series. Cards for each set are available in collectible tins, containing several booster packs and exclusive promotional cards in a metal box. By October 2006, seventeen series had been released in Japan with 417 unique cards. As of August 2008, ten of these series had been released in North America. \\n== Reception == \\n=== Sales ===\\nThe manga has 250 million copies in circulation worldwide, making it one of the best-selling manga series in history. More than half of the total circulation were in Japan, with the remaining circulation from 46 countries and regions. It has become one of North American publisher Viz Media\\'s best-selling manga series; their translation of the series appeared on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller lists several times. It was included in the fiction section of Teacher Librarian\\'s recommended list for 2008, and School Library Journal described it as an essential manga for school libraries.  Volume 28 of the manga reached seventeenth place in the USA Today Booklist in its first week of release in March 2008, only two places short of the record for a manga, held by Fruits Basket. The volume had one of the biggest debut weeks of any manga in years, becoming the top-selling manga volume of 2008 and the second best-selling book in North America. In 2010, Viz, the publisher, commented on the loyalty of readers, who reliably continued to buy the manga as the volume count went over 40. \\n=== Critical response ===\\nSeveral reviewers commented on the balance between fight scenes and plot development; A. E. Sparrow of IGN and Casey Brienza of Anime News Network felt that the result was a strong storyline, but Carl Kimlinger, also writing for the same website, suggested that there were too many fights, which slowed down the plot. Kimlinger liked the character designs, and approved of the fight scenes themselves which also drew positive comments from Rik Spanjers, who felt that the excitement of the scenes depends on Kishimoto\\'s skill in depicting action. Javier Lugo, writing for Manga Life, agreed, describing the artwork as \"dramatic, exciting, and just right for the story he\\'s telling\". Briana Lawrence from Mania Entertainment describes the growth of the characters gave Part II an adult feel. Writing for IGN, Ramsey Isler called Jutsu one of the most entertaining concepts in Naruto, stating as well that their diversity, complex signs required for techniques, the unique physical features, and the sheer destructive power of Ninjutsu are the elements that have made the series widely popular.\\nIn a review of volume 28 Brienza also praised Part II\\'s storyline and characterization, though she commented that not every volume reached a high level of quality. The fights across the Part II received praise, most notably Naruto\\'s and Sasuke\\'s, resulting in major changes into their character arcs. Meanwhile, the final battle between the two characters in the finale earned major praise for the choreography and art provided as well as how in depth the two\\'s personalities were shown in the aftermath. Some writers criticized Kaguya being the least entertaining villain, making the showdown between Naruto and Sasuke more appealing as a result. The finale earned nearly perfect scores from both Anime News Network and Comic Book Bin, with the latter acclaiming the popularity of the title character.\\nResponding to Naruto\\'s success, Kishimoto said in Naruto Collector Winter 2007/2008 that he was \"very glad that the American audience has accepted and understood ninja. It shows that the American audience has good taste [...] because it means they can accept something previously unfamiliar to them.\" Gō Itō, a professor in the manga department of Tokyo Polytechnic University, compared the series\\' development to the manga of Dragon Ball, saying that both manga present good illustrations of three-dimensional body movements that capture the characters\\' martial arts very well. Gō felt readers could empathize with the characters in Naruto via their inner monologue during battles. The series also influenced the movie Scott Pilgrim vs. The World with director Edgar Wright saying he was inspired by how whenever there is a \"killer move\" in the manga, there is an impact in the background following any technique\\'s usage.\\nWhen the manga ended, multiple authors from the magazine expressed congratulations to Kishimoto\\'s work. The fight scenes in general earned acclaim for how well written they are, something game developer CyberConnect2 took into account when developing the Naruto games. Christel Hoolans, managing director director of Kana and Le Lombard, called Naruto the first long-running series after Dragon Ball to become a classic in France. \\n=== Awards and accolades ===\\nNaruto won the Quill Award for graphic novel in 2006. In April 2007, volume 14 earned Viz the Manga Trade Paperback of the Year Gem Award from Diamond Comic Distributors. The manga was nominated for Favorite Manga Series in Nickelodeon Magazine\\'s 2009 Comics Awards. It won the 16th Spanish Manga Barcelona award for the shonen category in 2010. In 2015, the manga was nominated for the 19th Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize. Masashi Kishimoto was the winner of Rookie of the Year for the series in the Japanese government\\'s Agency for Cultural Affairs 2014 Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology Fine Arts Recommendation Awards. On TV Asahi\\'s Manga Sōsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150,000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, Naruto ranked seventh. \\n=== Themes ===\\nAmy Plumb argues that Kishimoto\\'s use of references to Japanese mythology in Naruto is intended to add further layers to the story. Kishimoto expects his readers to decode the references, which allows him to avoid direct explanations. One example is Itachi, who has three ninja techniques named after Shinto deities: Tsukiyomi, Amaterasu, and Susano-o. Plumb also cites Sasuke\\'s clan\\'s heraldic symbol, a fan known as an uchiwa. These fans are used in Japanese myths to exorcise evil, by blowing it away; Sasuke discovers late in the series that he has the ability to \"blow away\" the influence of the Nine-Tailed Fox on Naruto. Foxes (kitsune tsuki) are tricksters in Japanese mythology, and in some stories, they take over human bodies; Plumb comments on the obvious similarities to the Nine-Tail sealed in Naruto, and the pranks Naruto plays.\\nChristopher A. Born notes that the Naruto storyline contains traditional Confucian values, and suggests that students who analyse manga such as Naruto and Bleach will learn more about Confucianism than they would from studying its abstract ideas. Norman Melchor Robles Jr. evaluated the portrayal of both positive and negative ideas in Naruto by counting words in the script which were associated with either violence or positive values; he found that a small majority of tagged words were violent, but commented that the portrayal of violence seemed organized to show how positive strategies on the part of the protagonists could overcome the violence. Sheuo Hui Gan considers the series to have a set of \"traditional ethical values\". She also compares the treatment of alienation in Naruto, which Naruto overcomes by joining his society, to the portrayal of alienation in Akira and Neon Genesis Evangelion, where the main characters remain alienated.\\nNaruto has been described by several critics as a coming-of-age story. Psychologist Lawrence C. Rubin suggests that the storylines would appeal to readers of any age who have lost loved ones, or are having difficulty finding friends, or who are in other situations shown in the series. In Yukari Fujimoto\\'s view, as the characters mature, they show respect to the adults who have raised and taught them, making it a conservative storyline in comparison to other manga of the same time period such as One Piece and Air Gear. Rik Spanjers sees the difference between Sasuke (a loner) and Naruto (an optimist) as tragic, arguing that the contrast between the two protagonists\\' approach to the world is fundamental to the plot: \"Naruto\\'s strength grows as he gains more loved ones to protect, while Sasuke remains alone and is increasingly absorbed by his quest for revenge\". Omote Tomoyuki points out that there are many comic moments in the story despite the difficulties Naruto finds himself in, but the comic elements diminish dramatically over time as Naruto grows into a teenager, particularly once Part II begins. Shōnen Jump began to carry comedies such as Gintama and Reborn! from 2003 onwards, and in Tomoyuki\\'s view this is part of the reason for the change in emphasis: Naruto \"was not supposed to provide laughter anymore\".\\nFujimoto argues that the story has overly traditional gender roles, noting \"[...] its representations suggest that men are men and women are women and that they differ naturally regarding aptitude and vocation\". For example, the girls initially outperform the boys in the Ninja Academy, but \"once the boys get serious, the girls cannot keep pace\". Fujimoto points out that this does not upset Sakura, who is now surpassed by Naruto. Character development based on female roles, when it does occur, again uses stereotypical roles: Tsunade, for example, a middle-aged woman with large breasts, is a clear mother figure, and when she teaches Sakura to be a medical ninja, which requires special skills possessed only by women, the story reinforces the idea that women only belong on the battlefield as healers. Tsunade herself, who is a figure of authority in Naruto, is portrayed as ridiculous in a way that men in the same position are not. Fujimoto suggests this presentation of women may explain why the female characters are often the most disliked characters among readers of the manga. \\n== Naruto run == The Naruto run, or ninja run, is a running style based on the way the characters run leaning forward with their arms outstretched behind their backs. It became popular in 2017 when groups worldwide organized events to run like Naruto characters, especially on anniversaries of the series. On June 27, 2019, Matty Roberts posted a satirical event called \"Storm Area 51, They Can\\'t Stop All of Us\" on Facebook where he wrote \"We will all meet up at the Area 51 Alien Center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry. If we naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets. Let\\'s see them aliens.\" This quickly became an Internet meme, resulting in nationwide alerts and warnings issued by Nevada law enforcement and the U.S. Air Force to not go to Area 51. \\n== Notes == \\n=== Clarification === \\n=== Translations === \\n== References == \\n== External links ==',\n",
       " 'List_of_Naruto_characters': 'The Naruto (Japanese: ナルト) manga and anime series features an extensive cast of characters created by Masashi Kishimoto. The series takes place in a fictional universe where countries vie for power by employing ninja who can use special techniques and abilities in combat. The storyline is divided into two parts, simply named Part I and Part II, with the latter taking place two-and-a-half years after the conclusion of Part I. It is followed by the sequel series Boruto: Naruto Next Generations by Ukyō Kodachi, which continues where the epilogue of the first series left off. The series\\' storyline follows the adventures of a group of young ninja from the village of Konohagakure (Village Hidden in the Tree Leaves).\\nThe eponymous character of the first series is Naruto Uzumaki, an energetic ninja who wishes to become Hokage, the leader of Konohagakure and holds a monster called the Nine Tails in his body. During the early part of the series, Naruto is assigned to Team 7, in which he meets his rival Sasuke Uchiha, a taciturn and highly skilled \"genius\" of the Uchiha clan; Sakura Haruno, who is infatuated with Sasuke and has Naruto\\'s attention and Kakashi Hatake, the quiet and mysterious leader of the team. Over the course of the series, seeking out Sasuke when he ran away from the village, Naruto interacts with and befriends several fellow ninja in Konohagakure and other villages. He also encounters the series\\' antagonists, including Orochimaru, a former ninja of Konohagakure scheming to destroy his former home, as well as the elite ninja of the criminal organization Akatsuki who seek out jinchuriki like Gaara for the tailed beasts.\\nThe eponymous character of the second series is Boruto Uzumaki, the son of Naruto and Hinata Hyuga who is assigned to Team Konohamaru also known as Team 7, which includes Sasuke and Sakura\\'s daughter – Sarada Uchiha, Orochimaru\\'s artificially created son – Mitsuki and the group\\'s leader – Konohamaru, the Third Hokage\\'s grandson whom Naruto befriended as a child. Subsequently, Sarada is promoted to leader of the team in place of Konohamaru and joins them Kawaki, a young boy with a traumatic past who is taken in by the Uzumaki family, thus becoming the adopted son of Naruto and the adoptive brother of Boruto.\\nAs Kishimoto developed the series, he created the three primary characters as a basis for the designs of the other three-person teams. He also used characters in other shōnen manga as references in his design of the characters, a decision that was criticized by several anime and manga publications. The characters that Kishimoto developed, however, were praised for incorporating many of the better aspects of previous shōnen characters, although many publications lamented the perceived lack of growth beyond such stereotypes. The visual presentation of the characters was commented on by reviewers, with both praise and criticism given to Kishimoto\\'s work in the manga and anime adaptations. \\n== Creation and conception ==\\nWhen Masashi Kishimoto was originally creating the Naruto series, he looked to other shōnen manga for inspiration while still attempting to make his characters as unique as possible. Kishimoto cites Akira Toriyama\\'s Dragon Ball series as one of these influences, noting that Goku, the protagonist of Dragon Ball, was a key factor when creating Naruto Uzumaki due to his energetic and mischievous personality. To complement Naruto, Kishimoto worked on creating a rival that was a \"cool genius\", as he believed this was \"the archetypal rival character\". After reviewing different manga for ideas, he ultimately developed Sasuke Uchiha. When creating the primary heroine, Kishimoto admitted, \"I don\\'t have a definite image of what a heroine should be\". He eventually created Sakura Haruno, emphasizing \"her energy and flirtatious spirit\" as her primary characteristics. These three characters would be the mold for the other three main Naruto teams.\\nThe separation of the characters into different teams was intended to give each group a specific flavor. Kishimoto wished for each team member to be \"extreme\", having a high amount of aptitude in one given attribute, yet talentless in another. This approach was used to make each team perform best when individual members worked together to overcome their weaknesses. Having watched tokusatsu dramas as a child, Kishimoto wished for his teams to be different from the superhero teams in these dramas, dismissing the value of a team in which all the teammates were \"strong to the point of perfection\". Kishimoto notes that the different roles the characters assume is similar to many role-playing games, and \"each character stands out better that way\".\\nKishimoto inserted villains into the story to counteract the lead characters\\' moral values. He stated that this focus on illustrating the difference in values is central to his creation of villains to the point that, \"I don\\'t really think about them in combat\". The villains\\' physical appearances were also embellished to differentiate them from other characters, making it easier for a reader to follow the story and identify the villains, even in heated battle scenes. Kishimoto noted that making the villains \"flamboyant\" with a \"showy costume\" is \"one of my guiding principles\", as well as making them \"more memorable\".\\nWhen drawing the characters, Kishimoto consistently follows a five-step process: concept and rough sketch, drafting, inking, shading, and coloring. These steps are followed when he is drawing the manga and making the color illustrations that commonly adorn the cover of tankōbon, the cover of the Weekly Shōnen Jump, or other media, but the toolkit he uses occasionally changes. For instance, he used an airbrush for one illustration for a Weekly Shōnen Jump cover, but decided not to use it for future drawings largely due to the cleanup required. \\n== Main Characters == \\n=== Naruto ===\\nThe protagonists of the Naruto series are Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura Haruno, and Kakashi Hatake, who form \"Team 7\" (第7班, Dainanahan) of Konohagakure. After Sasuke Uchiha\\'s defection and Naruto\\'s departure from Konohagakure at the end of Part I, the team disbands. During Part II, the team reforms as \"Team Kakashi\" (カカシ班, Kakashi-Han) with two new members: Sai, who occupies Sasuke\\'s position, and Yamato, who becomes the acting Captain.[ch. 285] During the Fourth Great Ninja War, Team 7 reunites to fight Madara Uchiha and then Kaguya Ōtsutsuki when she possesses the former. Once the War is over, Naruto and Sasuke have their final battle that allow them to resolve their issues with their group fully reunited soon after. \\n==== Naruto Uzumaki ==== Naruto Uzumaki (うずまき ナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is the title character and main protagonist of the franchise. He was the first character created by Kishimoto during the conception of the series and was designed with many traits from other shōnen characters. He is often shunned by the Konohagakure villagers, as he is the host of Kurama, the Nine-Tailed Fox that attacked Konoha.[ch. 2] He became a ninja after training hard and being held back a few years in the Ninja Academy, learning ninjutsu and taijutsu skills, and compensates for this with his cheerful and boisterous personality as he developed his catchphrase \"Believe it!\" (～だってばよ, dattebayo), vowing to never give up on any goal he sets. In particular, Naruto has ambitions of becoming Hokage, the strongest ninja leader of Konohagakure, to gain the villagers\\' respect and be able to protect them. During a battle as a ninja, Naruto has mastered powerful various ninjutsu skills and abilities including the ability to create a massive and several clones of himself known as \"Shadow Clone Jutsu\", the ability to use his wind nature as he\\'s able to master a powerful spiral chakra sphere known as the \"Rasengan\" for the purposes of the offense, and other numerous abilities like using Nine-Tailed Fox\\'s chakra that increases his speed, strength, agility, and even whenever Naruto was enraged and goes feral but later in Part II he manage to control the Nine Tails\\' chakra. Over the course of the series, Naruto befriends many foreign and Konoha people and eventually claims a sizable positive impact on their lives, which grants him worldwide fame.[ch.. 450] Naruto eventually achieves his dream of becoming Hokage, marries Hinata Hyuga and has two children named Boruto Uzumaki and Himawari Uzumaki.[ch.. 700] Naruto is voiced by Junko Takeuchi in Japanese, and by Maile Flanagan in English. \\n==== Sasuke Uchiha ==== Sasuke Uchiha (うちは サスケ, Uchiha Sasuke) is Naruto\\'s rival and best friend. He was designed by Kishimoto as the \"cool genius\" since he felt this was an integral part of an ideal rivalry. Sasuke\\'s older brother, Itachi Uchiha, killed the rest of their family.[ch. 224] Because of this, Sasuke\\'s sole desire is to kill his brother, and he develops a cold and withdrawn personality, seeing people as tools to further his goals, although also gaining the affection of most of the girls he knows, much to his annoyance. After he becomes a member of Team 7, Sasuke seems to begin considering his teammates precious to the point of risking his life to protect them, while focusing on revenge less than at the start of the series. When during the battle, Sasuke is a taijutsu expert and has mastered his ability to manipulate numerous fire techniques including known as \"Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu\", manipulating a fury of lightning known as \"Chidori\" and as a member of the Uchiha clan, he uses the Sharingan that allows him to senses the opponent\\'s moves and attacks. Following an encounter and a subsequent defeat at the hands of his brother in Part I, however, Sasuke severs his ties and leaves the village to seek more power from Orochimaru. By the events of the Boruto franchise, Sasuke has become a vigilante investigating the Otsutsuki clan for Konohagakure and takes Boruto under his wing. Sasuke is voiced by Noriaki Sugiyama in the Japanese anime, while his English voice actor is Yuri Lowenthal. \\n==== Sakura Haruno ==== Sakura Haruno (春野 サクラ, Haruno Sakura) is a member of Team 7. While creating the character, Kishimoto has admitted that he had little perception of what an ideal girl should be like. As a child, Sakura was teased by other children because of her large forehead, a feature Kishimoto tried to emphasize in Sakura\\'s appearance. She was comforted by Ino Yamanaka and the two developed a friendship. However, as the two grew, they became increasingly distant due to their shared affection for Sasuke Uchiha. As a kunoichi, Sakura possesses superier strength to unleash her powerful punch towards the opponents when she is enraged by saying \"Cha!\" (しゃーんなろー！, Shānnarō!) and as a medical ninja, she can heal every wounds whenever they are injured. During the early moments of Part I, Sakura is infatuated with Sasuke and resents Naruto Uzumaki, although Sasuke views her as \"annoying\" and Naruto has feelings for her.[ch. 3] Her perception on Naruto eventually changes, however, and she comes to see him as a friend, while her feelings for Sasuke grow into deep love. In the Japanese anime, her voice actress is Chie Nakamura, and she is voiced by Kate Higgins in the English adaptation. \\n==== Kakashi Hatake ==== Kakashi Hatake is the easygoing, smart leader of team 7, consisting of Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. Kakashi had a dark past, but is unaffected by it as an adult. He was a very vital key for Naruto\\'s success, training him to be a great ninja. Like Sasuke, Kakashi is also a master of the Sharingan, which he gained as a present from his late friend, Obito Uchiha, and can manipulate \"Lightning Blade\" similar to Sasuke\\'s Chidori. Facing Obito after learning he survived and became apprentice of Madara\\'s, Kakashi\\'s original eye was restored late into series\\'s second half and briefing regaining the Sharingan when Obito aids him in spirit to help in the fight against Kaguya. Kakashi succeeds Tsunade as the Sixth Hokage after the Fourth Great Ninja War have ended, with Naruto succeeding him years later. \\n=== Boruto: Naruto Next Generations ===\\nThe protagonists of the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations series are Naruto and Hinata\\'s son Boruto Uzumaki, Sasuke and Sakura\\'s daughter Sarada Uchiha, Orochimaru\\'s son Mitsuki, and Konohamaru Sarutobi who form \"Team Konohamaru\" (木ノ葉丸班, Konohamaru-Han). Prior to their series, Konohamaru was a supporting character in the Naruto series while Boruto, Sarada, and Mitsuki were introduced in the Naruto epilogue.[ch. 700] \\n==== Boruto Uzumaki ==== Boruto Uzumaki (うずまき ボルト, Uzumaki Boruto) is the son of Naruto Uzumaki and Hinata Hyuga who attends Konoha\\'s ninja academy, inheriting his paternal family\\'s short blond hair, blue eyes and \"Believe it!\" (だってばさ, dattebasa) verbal tic. He also inherits his maternal family\\'s Gentle Fist technique despite not inheriting the Byakugan, unlike his sister Himawari. Just as his father pulled pranks to have his existence acknowledged, Boruto commits mischief to get his father\\'s attention after his rise to Hokage, such as defacing the Hokage Monument during the events of the series epilogue. Boruto also admires his father\\'s rival and friend Sasuke, seeking his training in order to surpass his father, later being accepted as his student.[ch. 700] In Boruto: Naruto the Movie, and its retellings, Boruto joins the Chunin Exams with his best friend Shikadai and their teammates, and attempts to cheat his way through the exams. When Naruto gets abducted by Momoshiki, Boruto makes peace with his father and helps him and Sasuke defeat the Otsutsuki, and is branded by the dying entity with a mark called the Kama. He resolves to take Sasuke\\'s path to aid the Hokage from the shadows. While able to use a Rasengan, Boruto accidentally develops the Vanishing Rasengan as a signature attack. Boruto can activate a Byakugan-like dojutsu in his right eye, though not at will. In the Japanese version, Boruto is voiced by Kokoro Kikuchi in The Last: Naruto the Movie and by Yuuko Sanpei in all subsequent appearances. In the English version, he is voiced by Maile Flanagan in The Last and by Amanda C. Miller in all subsequent appearances. \\n==== Sarada Uchiha ==== Sarada Uchiha (うちは サラダ, Uchiha Sarada) is the daughter of Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. She seems to have inherited traits from both her parents, like her mother\\'s \"Cha!\" (しゃーんなろー!, Shānnarō!) verbal tic and her father\\'s aloofness and reluctance to acknowledge and commend others. Sarada is the central character of Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring, searching for her estranged father while mistakenly feeling she and Sakura are not related. Gaining her Sharingan in the process, but not having a good first impression of her father Sasuke, Sarada feels hurt and betrayed when she incorrectly suspects being Karin\\'s biological child as the two wear similar glasses. While Naruto helps her realize that family is not a matter of blood, Sarada eventually learns that Sakura is her biological mother as Karin later explains she was Sakura\\'s midwife. Before leaving again, Sasuke shows Sarada how much he loves her by poking her forehead, and promises to come home soon. Having admired Naruto and his dedication to his village, Sarada makes it her goal to become the next Hokage. Sarada is voiced by Kokoro Kikuchi in Japanese, while in the English version she is voiced by Laura Bailey in Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 and by Cherami Leigh in all subsequent appearances. \\n==== Mitsuki ==== Mitsuki (ミツキ) is a teammate of Boruto and Sarada, a mysterious boy with a calm mind and a penchant for making snide remarks. His backstory is explored in Naruto Gaiden: The Road Illuminated by the Full Moon, which reveals that Mitsuki is an artificial human created by Orochimaru, and a modified clone of him, gaining the name Mitsuki from the fact that he is a \"vessel\" (杯, tsuki) for the \"snake\" (巳, mi) to inhabit. He tested by Orochimaru and another of his creations called Log (ログ, Rogu) to determine his allegiance; Mitsuki decided to follow his own path as the \"moon\" instead of a vessel, setting out toward the Hidden Leaf to find his \"sun\": Boruto Uzumaki. Mitsuki can extend his limbs by using chakra to dislocate his joints, while the experimentation by Orochimaru allows him to access Sage Mode. He is voiced by Ryūichi Kijima in Japanese and by Robbie Daymond in the English dub. \\n==== Kawaki ==== Kawaki (カワキ, Kawaki) is a tattooed youth who became a member of Kara after being brought by Jigen from a drunkard father, bearing a tattoo of the Roman numeral IX under his left eye and bestowed a Kama mark by Jigen to be made into a living weapon for Kara. He was heavily modified with microscopic Shinobi-Ware implanted in his body that give him abilities similar to Jugo\\'s Sage Transformation in altering his physiology at a cellular level. For reasons yet to be revealed, Kawaki left Kara and encountered Boruto who brings him to the Hidden Leaf as he lives with the Uzumaki family. The two would end up becoming enemies as hinted in prologue of the Boruto series, an older Kawaki appearing to have perpetrated Konoha\\'s destruction as he confronts an older Boruto while declaring the age of shinobi has come to an end. His voice actor in the Japanese anime is Yūma Uchida and Michael Schwalbe voices him in the English dub. \\n==== Konohamaru Sarutobi ====\\nKonohamaru Sarutobi (猿飛 木ノ葉丸, Sarutobi Konohamaru), named after Konohagakure, is the grandson of the Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi. He strives to replace his grandfather as Hokage so the villagers will recognize him by name, not simply as the Hokage\\'s grandson. He looks to Naruto as a mentor in this quest, emulating his work ethic, determination, and signature jutsu such as the Rasengan and the Sexy Jutsu. Konohamaru insists, however, that he will only become Hokage after Naruto has been Hokage first.[ch. 2] By the series epilogue, Konohamaru has ascended to the rank of jonin and is the captain of Team Konohamaru. Konohamaru\\'s design caused great difficulties for Masashi Kishimoto; he intended for Konohamaru to look like a \"punk\" smaller than Naruto, yet all of his attempts resulted in a recreation of Naruto. He eventually gave Konohamaru small, angry-looking eyes and was instantly happy with the design.[vol. 2:26] While voiced in the Japanese anime by Ikue Ōtani and by Akiko Koike as a stand-in, Konohamaru\\'s adult self is voiced by Hidenori Takahashi. In the English version, Colleen O\\'Shaughnessey voices Konohamaru\\'s pre-adult self, and Max Mittelman voices his adult self. \\n== Secondary characters == \\n=== Team 8 ===\\nTeam 8 (第8班, Daihappan) is a group of Konohagakure ninja led by Kurenai Yuhi. The members of Team 8 primarily concentrate on tracking, with each of the members\\' unique abilities used in this role. During Part II, Team 8, excluding Kurenai due to her pregnancy, joins Naruto Uzumaki and Team 7 in their search for Itachi Uchiha and Sasuke Uchiha.[ch. 354] \\n==== Hinata Hyuga ==== Hinata Hyuga (日向 ヒナタ, Hyūga Hinata) is a member of Team 8 who suffers from a lack of self-confidence. Though born of the Hyuga clan\\'s main house and raised to become future head of the clan, Hinata\\'s shyness and inability to stand up for herself resulted in the strong disapproval of her father Hiashi after being defeated by her younger sister Hanabi, who became their father\\'s successor. Hinata was then disowned by Hiashi and placed in the care of Kurenai Yuhi.[ch. 78] Under Kurenai\\'s guidance, Hinata began training her strength in both skill and will in order to prove her worth to her father.[ch. 238] Hinata\\'s growing self-confidence mainly comes from her long-standing admiration for Naruto, as she is inspired by his enthusiasm and unyielding determination to never give up. As the series progresses, Hinata\\'s admiration towards Naruto eventually grows into love. During Part II, Hinata confesses her feelings to Naruto while protecting him from Pain and later assists him during the Allied Ninjas\\' battle with the Ten-Tails.[ch. 437, 615] Following the end of the Fourth Great Ninja War, and the events of The Last: Naruto the Movie where she carries out the will of her ancestor Hamura Ōtsutsuki by helping Naruto stop Toneri, Hinata marries Naruto and they have two children by the series epilogue. Her voice actress in the Japanese anime is Nana Mizuki, and her English voice actress is Stephanie Sheh. \\n==== Kiba Inuzuka ====\\nKiba Inuzuka (犬塚 キバ, Inuzuka Kiba) is a member of Team 8 from the Inuzuka Clan, a group of ninja with canine characteristics who train alongside their ninja dog (忍犬, ninken) partners. In stark contrast to his teammates, Kiba is brash, impulsive, and loud-mouthed, and considers Naruto a rival after Naruto defeats him in the Chunin Exams. Despite this, he is very protective of his teammates, and displays the same loyalty to Akamaru, unwilling to abandon him and putting himself in harm\\'s way for Akamaru\\'s sake.[ch. 204] In exchange for Kiba\\'s devotion, Akamaru fights with him in battle; he uses his heightened senses to Kiba\\'s advantage, and helps double-team opponents with volleys of physical attacks. Since Akamaru is naturally better equipped for combat, Kiba usually modifies his own abilities at the start of a battle, growing claws and running on four limbs to increase his speed.[ch. 75] He can also drastically increase his sense of smell, and by the second half of the series he can use it to track things dogs cannot.[ch. 364] In the series epilogue, Kiba ends up living with Tamaki, the granddaughter of the Uchiha Clan\\'s supporter Granny Cat, and the two house various dogs and cats. Kiba\\'s voice actor in the Japanese anime is Kōsuke Toriumi, and his English voice actor is Kyle Hebert. \\n==== Akamaru ====\\nAkamaru (赤丸) is Kiba Inuzuka\\'s ninja dog, best friend, and constant companion. At the start of the series, Kiba carries Akamaru around on his head or inside his jacket. By Part II of the Naruto storyline, Akamaru grows large enough for Kiba to ride atop his back, though Kiba comically fails to notice this drastic difference.[ch. 282] With his heightened sense of smell, hearing, and ability to detect others\\' chakra levels, Akamaru acts as a valuable tool for Kiba in hostile situations. To help Kiba beat track of opponents, Akamaru uses scent marking, though in battle he relies on Kiba to provide the chakra for the combination attacks they execute, which require Akamaru to transform into a clone of Kiba.[ch. 203] In the series epilogue, an aged Akamaru fathers a litter of puppies, among the assortment of animals living with Kiba and Tamaki. In the original Japanese anime, Akamaru is voiced by Junko Takeuchi, also the voice actor for Naruto Uzumaki, and Kōsuke Toriumi, who voices Kiba, when Akamaru transforms into a clone of Kiba. In the English adaptation of the anime, Akamaru\\'s vocal effects as a puppy are provided by Jamie Simone though Kyle Hebert provided the voice of Akamaru when he took Kiba\\'s form. \\n==== Shino Aburame ====\\nShino Aburame (油女 シノ, Aburame Shino) is a member of Team 8 from the Aburame Clan, a group of ninja who formed a symbiosis with a special breed of insects known as \"destruction bugs\" (寄壊蟲, kikaichū) by allowing the insects to use their bodies as hives. During a battle, Shino directs his bugs towards an opponent, boxing them in and absorbing their chakra once they have been surrounded. Shino\\'s merciless tendencies towards opponents, as well as his attachment to and collection of insects,[ch. 172] have caused other characters to label him as \"creepy\".[ch. 70] Nevertheless, Shino cares deeply for his teammates, being acutely aware of their inner workings and always regretting when he is unable to help them;[ch. 238] he is also capable of childish emotions, as shown in the anime when he sulks after Naruto (returning after two and a half years) fails to remember his name or recognize him. In the series epilogue, Shino becomes a Ninja Academy teacher. In the Japanese anime, his voice actor is Shinji Kawada. His first voice actor in the English anime was Sam Riegel, who voiced Shino in episodes 23 and 24, but in all following appearances, he has been voiced by Derek Stephen Prince. \\n==== Kurenai Yuhi ====\\nKurenai Yuhi (夕日 紅, Yūhi Kurenai) is the leader of Team 8, a skilled user of genjutsu, particularly skilled with illusions involving plants.[ch. 141] Of all her students, Kurenai is closest with Hinata, acting as a surrogate parent in the absence of Hinata\\'s father, and helping Hinata overcome her weaknesses.[ch. 78] Whenever Kurenai appears in the series, she is usually accompanied by her childhood friend Asuma Sarutobi, and during Part II of the series, Kurenai is revealed to be pregnant with Asuma\\'s child.[ch. 342] Several months after Asuma\\'s death, Kurenai gave birth to their daughter Mirai Sarutobi, who later becomes a kunoichi by the events of the series epilogue.[ch. 533, 700] In the Japanese anime, her voice actress is Rumi Ochiai. In the English adaptation of the anime, she was voiced by Saffron Henderson in episode three, and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn in all subsequent appearances. \\n=== Team 10 ===\\nTeam 10 (第10班, Daijippan) is a group of Konohagakure ninja led by Asuma Sarutobi. The fathers of the three team members Choji Akimichi, Shikamaru Nara, and Ino Yamanaka were also on a team together, and both generations refer to their team using the moniker \"Ino-Shika-Cho\".[ch. 137] During Part II, Asuma is slain in an encounter with members of Akatsuki, and Kakashi Hatake briefly assumes leadership of the team to hunt down those responsible for Asuma\\'s death.[ch. 331] In the series epilogue, the three living members of Team Asuma are training their children to become the next \"Ino-Shika-Cho\" group. \\n==== Shikamaru Nara ==== Shikamaru Nara (奈良 シカマル, Nara Shikamaru) is a member of Team 10. Creator Kishimoto has noted that he \"likes\" Shikamaru due to his easygoing nature despite being a genius, and contrasted him against Sasuke Uchiha\\'s intelligent but abrasive personality. Shikamaru\\'s intelligence is such that Asuma Sarutobi, Team 10\\'s leader, is never able to defeat Shikamaru at games such as shogi or go, and he can devise complex strategies even in the heat of battle. However, his laziness frequently prevents him from effectively utilizing his intelligence.[ch. 107] Shikamaru is a longtime friend of Choji Akimichi, choosing to look upon Choji as a person without considering his large girth. Despite thinking of Naruto a bit poorly and often getting annoyed by him, he is one of the few people to have acknowledged him as a person rather than the tailed beast in childhood, remaining one of Naruto\\'s close friends since then.[ch. 190] In battle, Shikamaru can manipulate his shadow, and, by extending it into another person\\'s shadow, can force the target to mimic his movements.[ch. 107] In the series epilogue, Shikamaru works as Naruto\\'s advisor and is revealed to have married Temari, who had moved to the Hidden Leaf, and with whom he has a son, Shikadai. In the Japanese anime, Shikamaru\\'s voice actor is Showtaro Morikubo, although Nobutoshi Canna acted as a stand-in for Morikubo in episode 141. His English voice actor is Tom Gibis. \\n==== Choji Akimichi ====\\nChoji Akimichi (秋道 チョウジ, Akimichi Chōji) is a member of Team 10, typified by his affinity for food. Though his habit of always eating gives him a relatively portly appearance, Choji insists he is not fat, instead using explanations like being \"big-boned\". If someone refers to him as fat, Choji instantly becomes hostile and increases his resolve to battle,[ch. 55] even killing one of the Sound Four during one occurrence. Shikamaru Nara has never found an issue with Choji\\'s weight, instead choosing to look upon Choji\\'s inner strength. Because of this, Choji regards him as his best friend, stating he would willingly give his life to defend Shikamaru.[ch. 190] In battle, Choji can increase the size of his body to improve the amount of damage his strikes deal upon impact.[ch. 189] He can also use his clan\\'s signature Calorie Control (カロリーコントロール, Karorī Kontorōru) which converts his body fat to chakra.[ch. 190] In the series epilogue, Choji has married Karui of the Hidden Cloud Village and they have a daughter Chocho Akimichi. His voice actor in the Japanese anime is Kentarō Itō and his English voice actor is Robbie Rist. \\n==== Ino Yamanaka ====\\nIno Yamanaka (山中 いの, Yamanaka Ino) is a member of Team 10 and Yamanaka Clan, and the only daughter of Inoichi Yamanaka, typified by her affinity of being fashionable and good looks, making her a popular girl in the academy. She is a childhood friend of Sakura Haruno, helping her to develop her own identity and defending her from bullies. When they discovered that they both liked Sasuke Uchiha, their friendship was ended.[ch. 71] The two eventually make amends and rekindle their friendship, but still maintain a competitive attitude toward each other.[ch. 73] In the anime, when Sakura begins to excel in healing techniques, Ino becomes motivated to learn Medical Ninjutsu, hoping to be even more useful to her friends and teammates as an able medical ninja. In terms of combat abilities, Ino specializes in mind-altering techniques. Ino can transfer her consciousness to her target\\'s mind, gaining control over their body and actions which she can then use to attack others, to spy or to immobilize/distract.[ch. 55] She can also communicate telepathically by connecting minds of people around her, and in addition, she is a sensory ninja, able to detect chakra around her. During the death of her father, it was revealed that Ino was raised to embody the title of the \\'Purple Buschlover\\' represented in the Yamanaka Clan\\'s crest, which is a blunt and candid love that treasures bonds. In the series\\' epilogue, Ino has married Sai and they have a son, Inojin, and become the head of her clan and the Leader of the Village\\'s Sensory Unit as well as the owner of her family\\'s flowershop. In the Japanese anime, her voice actress is Ryōka Yuzuki, and her voice actress in the English adaptation is Colleen O\\'Shaughnessey. \\n==== Asuma Sarutobi ====\\nAsuma Sarutobi (猿飛 アスマ, Sarutobi Asuma) was the leader of Team 10 and son of the Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi and uncle of Konohamaru Sarutobi. In battle, Asuma wielded trench knives that he could infuse with his wind nature chakra to extend the blades\\' length and sharpness.[ch. 317] When he was younger, Asuma had a dispute with his father and briefly left Konohagakure in protest, gaining fame as a member of the Land of Fire\\'s Twelve Guardian Shinobi. Though Asuma eventually returned, gaining the resolve to protect Konoha\\'s next generation from his experiences outside his home, he never completely reconciled with his father by the time of Hiruzen\\'s death.[ch. 314] Asuma was usually seen smoking a cigarette, but would temporarily drop the habit when something was bothering him, such as when his father died.[ch. 321] Among all his students, Asuma shared a particularly close relationship with Shikamaru Nara, often playing go or shogi together.[ch. 107] Asuma frequently appears alongside his childhood friend Kurenai Yuhi, denying having a relation before it is revealed that Kurenai is bearing his child.[ch. 140, 342] After Asuma is killed by Hidan of the criminal organization Akatsuki, Shikamaru inherited his mentor\\'s ideals as he uses his knuckles to defeat Hidan. During the Fourth Great Ninja War, Asuma is brought back with the Reanimation Jutsu to fight for Kabuto before being defeated by his students and sealed until his soul is allowed to return to the afterlife. Asuma\\'s voice actor in the Japanese anime is Jūrōta Kosugi, and he is voiced by Doug Erholtz in the English adaptation. \\n=== Team Guy ===\\nTeam Guy (ガイ班, Gai-Han) is a group of Konohagakure ninja led by Might Guy. The members of Team Guy primarily concentrate on physical attacks and weapons. They are a year older than the other members of Konohagakure\\'s teams, as Guy wanted to wait a year before they could take the test to advance in ninja rank and become Chunin. In Part II, Team Guy joins Team 7 in an attempt to save Gaara from the criminal organization, Akatsuki.[ch. 253] \\n==== Rock Lee ==== Rock Lee (ロック・リー, Rokku Rī) is a member of Team Guy and the favorite student of team leader Might Guy. In the ninja academy, Rock Lee was unable to use ninjutsu or genjutsu techniques, but his persistence impressed Guy. Guy spends much of his free time training with Lee to help him accomplish his dream of becoming a respected ninja by using only taijutsu. Lee has adopted several of Guy\\'s habits because of this, such as his wardrobe and his perseverance.[ch. 84] Guy has taught him a number of powerful, even forbidden, techniques. Because some of these techniques, such as the ability to open the eight chakra gates, can pose a severe risk to Lee\\'s body, he is only permitted to use them to protect something or someone dear to him. During the Chunin Exams, Lee loses use of both his left arm and leg, but his injuries are healed following Tsunade\\'s return to Konoha[ch. 52]. In the Japanese anime, his voice actor is Yoichi Masukawa, and his voice actor is Brian Donovan in English. \\n==== Neji Hyuga ====\\nNeji Hyuga (日向 ネジ, Hyūga Neji) was a member of Team Guy and a child prodigy of the Hyuga clan, as well as Hinata\\'s cousin.[ch. 101] As he was the only ninja of his generation to be promoted to the rank of Jonin during Part II, he frequently acted as leader of his assigned teams and the secondary leader of Team Guy when Might Guy is absent. Though a member of the branch house, Neji displayed his title as a prodigy of the Hyuga throughout the series as a master of his clan\\'s Gentle Fist style of combat that he taught to himself.[ch. 101] Originally, Neji believed in a fatalistic philosophy: that one\\'s destiny is inescapable and that a weak person will always be weak.[ch. 38]\\nAfter being defeated in the Chunin Exams by Naruto Uzumaki, who defied his own \"fate\", Neji had a change of heart once Uncle Hiashi reveals the full story of his father\\'s death, Hizashi, as an act of self-sacrifice in place of his twin brother. Neji then abandons his belief in determinism and resolves to get strong enough to never lose a battle and change the fates of his loved ones.[ch. 197] As the series progressed, Neji refined his Gentle Fist and devised original variations that either increased their potency or fixed flaws such as the blind spot in his Byakugan.[ch. 197] Neji also remedied the estranged relations between himself and the members of the main house, resulting in his training with Hiashi and Hinata at the end of Part I.[ch. 238] Neji is killed during the Fourth Great Ninja War as he sacrificed himself to protect Naruto and Hinata from Obito Uchiha\\'s attack, telling Naruto that he made the choice to die protecting those dear to him as his father had. Following the war\\'s conclusion, a memorial was held in Neji\\'s honor. Years after the war, Naruto paid tribute to Neji by naming his son Boruto whose name means \"bolt\" while Neji\\'s name means \"screw\". In the Japanese anime, his voice actor is Kōichi Tōchika, and when he is featured as a child, he is voiced by Keiko Nemoto. His voice in the English anime is provided by Steve Staley, and Wendee Lee provides his child voice. \\n==== Tenten ====\\nTenten (テンテン) is a member of Team Guy. Of all the Naruto protagonists, Tenten receives the least screen time in the series.[ch. 73]. In battle, Tenten specializes in weaponry, ranging from projectiles to close-combat weapons and even explosives by the second part of the series. Tenten uses this expertise to help Neji Hyuga train his defensive techniques, and she holds him in high regard since he can always block her attacks.[ch. 98] In the series epilogue, Tenten runs her own weapons shop. Her Japanese voice actress is Yukari Tamura, and her English voice actress is Danielle Judovits. \\n==== Might Guy ==== Might Guy (マイト・ガイ, Maito Gai) is the leader of Team Guy who dedicates most of his time to his pupil Rock Lee, who emulates himself in his sensei\\'s image and ideals, including his \"My Rules\" philosophy, which involves setting tough self-imposed penalties for failure in the belief that the punishment will make him stronger.[ch. 180] Like Lee, Guy relies on his mastery of taijutsu, but unlike his pupil he is fully capable of using ninjutsu and genjutsu. He taught Lee many of the techniques he learned from his father Might Duy, such as the ability to unlock the Eight Gates which safely restrict the flow of chakra through the body. When not teaching Lee, Guy is usually found competing with his self-proclaimed childhood rival, Kakashi Hatake. Throughout the series, Kakashi never displays a particular interest in their rivalry, which only further motivates Guy to defeat him.[ch. 65] Guy is an extremely capable ninja as seen in his fight against Itachi Uchiha and his recurring confrontations with Kisame Hoshigaki,[ch. 143] beating him single-handedly on two occasions.[ch. 258][ch. 506] During the Fourth Great Ninja War, Guy is forced to use the Eighth Gate in a failed attempt to defeat Madara. Though Naruto uses the power of the Sage of Six Paths to save his life, Guy\\'s right leg is too damaged to be fully healed. Though he is not wavered from his shinobi career, he remains in a paraplegic state by the events of the epilogue.\\nSeries creator Masashi Kishimoto had likened Guy\\'s passionate personality to that of a physical education teacher he had in junior high school, but notes that the teacher was not a model for Guy\\'s character. In the Japanese anime, his voice actor is Masashi Ebara (who also voices Guy\\'s father, Duy), with Mayuki Makiguchi voicing him as a child. In the English anime, Guy is voiced by Skip Stellrecht (except in Rock Lee and his Ninja Pals, where he is voiced by Matthew Mercer), with Todd Haberkorn voicing him as a child. \\n=== Sand Siblings ===\\nThe Sand Siblings (砂の三姉弟, Suna no Sankyōdai) are ninjas from the village of Sunagakure and the children of the Fourth Kazekage, the former leader of the village.[ch. 59] They come to Konohagakure to participate in the biannual Chunin exams, and serve as antagonists in the subsequent invasion of Konohagakure. Because of their interactions with Naruto Uzumaki, and learning their father was murdered by their supposed ally Orochimaru, the Sand Siblings return as allies of Konohagakure, aiding Naruto\\'s group in their attempts to retrieve Sasuke Uchiha from Orochimaru\\'s forces. Kishimoto changed their costumes for their return due to the difficulty in drawing their original attire, as well as to symbolize their new friendship with Konohagakure. In Part II, Gaara becomes Kazekage with his older siblings serving under him as his bodyguards during the Kage Summit at the Land of Iron. \\n==== Baki ====\\nBaki is the Sand Siblings\\' instructor and a member of Sunagakure\\'s advisory council. He killed Gekko Hayate during the Konoha Crush. \\n==== Gaara ==== Gaara (我愛羅) is the youngest of the three siblings, created as a foil to Naruto Uzumaki, with a similar background yet a highly divergent personality. Before being born, Gaara was made into a weapon by his father by becoming the Jinchuriki of the Tailed Beast Shukaku the One-Tail (一尾の守鶴, Ichibi no Shukaku). This act caused the death of his mother during labor and Gaara was placed in the care of his mother\\'s younger brother. Like any other Jinchuriki and because his sand unconsciously attacked those around him when he was threatened, Gaara was tormented by his fellow villagers as well as his uncle.[ch. 131] Unlike Naruto, however, Gaara comes to see himself as omnipotent and that anyone who challenges him or his power must die. When he battles Naruto during the invasion of Konoha, learning that he is also a Jinchuriki like himself, Gaara\\'s outlook changes as he resolves to help others and he succeeds his deceased father as Sunagakure\\'s Fifth Kazekage during Part II.[ch. 249] Gaara\\'s Japanese voice actor is Akira Ishida and his English voice actor is Liam O\\'Brien. \\n==== Kankuro ====\\nKankuro (カンクロウ, Kankurō) is the middle of the three siblings. For the first half of the series, he is frequently at odds with Gaara, though he tends to hold his tongue for fear of being killed.[ch. 36] In Part II, once Gaara begins to reveal his dreams and motivations to Kankuro, Kankuro becomes very protective of Gaara; he lashes out at anyone who speaks poorly of Gaara and when Gaara is kidnapped, he readily risks his life to save him.[ch. 249] Kankuro is a talented puppeteer, normally using his bladed attack puppet Crow (烏, Karasu) and trapping puppet Black Ant (黒蟻, Kuroari) in combination attacks. He also possesses the large puppet Salamander (山椒魚, Sanshōuo) that provides him with combination defense and offense. After his puppets were destroyed by their creator, Kankuro gains a new puppet in Sasori\\'s lifeless body Scorpion (蠍, Sasori) and modifies it for his use as a normal puppet. During the Fourth Great Ninja War, after defeating the reanimated Sasori and breaking Kabuto\\'s hold over him, Kankuro is entrusted with the Mother and Father puppets. In the series epilogue, Kankuro continues to serve as Gaara\\'s bodyguard. In the Japanese anime, his voice actor is Yasuyuki Kase, and his English voice actor is Michael Lindsay, until he was replaced by Doug Erholtz in 2013 (after the former retired the previous year). \\n==== Temari ====\\nTemari (テマリ) is the oldest of the three siblings. Unlike her more combat-loving brothers, Temari values peace, as she questions Sunagakure\\'s justifications for going to war with Konohagakure.[ch. 95] This trait carries over to Part II, in which she begins acting as a liaison between Sunagakure and Konohagakure to help the two villages work together. In her time in Konohagakure, Temari is often seen walking with Shikamaru Nara, causing other characters to think they are dating, although both deny this.[ch. 247] In battle, Temari wields a giant iron fan that can create powerful gusts of wind capable of leveling the surrounding landscape. As she is skilled at deducing an opponent\\'s strategies and weaknesses soon after a battle begins, she typically uses her winds to remove parts of the battlefield that might be advantageous to the enemy.[ch. 107] During Part I of the series, Temari is able to use the Summoning Jutsu, in which she can summon a powerful scythe-wielding weasel called Kamatari (カマタリ).[ch. 214] In the series epilogue, Temari is revealed to have moved to the Hidden Leaf and married Shikamaru, with whom she has a son, Shikadai.[ch. 700] Temari\\'s voice actress in the Japanese anime is Romi Park and her English voice actress is Tara Platt. \\n=== Team Moegi ===\\nTeam Moegi (モエギ班, Moegi-Han) is a group of Konohagakure ninja led by Moegi Kazamatsuri who appears in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. The three members are the newest generation of the Ino-Shika-Cho, a generational team encompassing members of the Akimichi, Nara, and Yamanaka clans. \\n==== Shikadai Nara ====\\nShikadai Nara (奈良 シカダイ, Nara Shikadai) is the son of Shikamaru Nara and Temari, and Boruto\\'s best friend, who attends Konoha\\'s ninja academy.[ch. 700] He inherits his father\\'s relaxed unenthusiastic personality and fighting style through the Shadow Imitation Technique while blunt and outspoken like his mother. During the events of Boruto: Naruto the Movie, Shikadai faces Boruto in the Chunin Exam finals and is deemed the winner by default because Boruto was discovered to having cheated during their match. Shikadai is voiced by Kenshō Ono in Japanese and by Todd Haberkorn in the English dub. \\n==== Chocho Akimichi ====\\nChocho Akimichi (秋道 チョウチョウ, Akimichi Chōchō) is the daughter of Choji Akimichi and Karui who attends Konoha\\'s ninja academy.[ch. 700] Like her father, inheriting the Akimichi\\'s clan fighting style, she never turns down an invitation when it comes to food and is quite confident and self-assured about herself, a trait she perhaps inherited from her mother. But during the events of Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring, Chocho becomes conscious of her weight while starting to think that she might be an adopted child. Chocho accompanies her friend Sarada in search of her father, Sasuke, believing the trip to be in search of her \"real\" father instead. When she witnesses her father\\'s slender figure, she becomes eager to learn the technique. Chocho is voiced by Ryoko Shiraishi in Japanese and by Colleen Villard in the English dub. \\n==== Inojin Yamanaka ====\\nInojin Yamanaka (山中 いのじん, Yamanaka Inojin) is the son of Sai and Ino Yamanaka who attends Konoha\\'s ninja academy.[ch. 700].

Sumire inherited a curse mark devised by her father, a former Foundation member named Tanuki Shigaraki, that allows her to summon an artificial creature called Nue. In the first arc of the anime, orphaned as a result of the former Foundation members being ostracized, Sumire wished to continue her father\\'s work in taking revenge on the Hidden Leaf, but Boruto convinces her to let go of her past and find her own path. Sumire later graduates to a genin and becomes a member of an all-kunoichi team, later gaining a place in the Scientific Ninja Weapons Team. Sumire is voiced by Aya Endō in Japanese and by Erica Lindbeck in the English dub. \\n==== Namida Suzumeno ====\\nNamida Suzumeno (雀乃 なみだ, Suzumeno Namida) is a Konohagakure ninja genin who is prone to crying, possessing a jutsu that produces a high-pitch sound wave capable of incapacitate those who hear her.

After a failed coup d\\'état, wherein he tried to assassinate the Fourth Mizukage, Zabuza and his followers fled the village and began working as mercenary assassins.[ch. 30] He also takes in a young boy, Haku, as his apprentice, mostly treating him as a tool although he ultimately does care for him.[ch. 32] Zabuza is skilled in water-based abilities, but his area of expertise is in assassinations in areas covered by mist.[ch. 26] His talents lead to his commission by a criminal named Gato to kill a man named Tazuna, which he is unable to perform due to interference by Tazuna\\'s bodyguard, Kakashi Hatake. Because he takes too long to complete the task, his contract is revoked, and his employer tries to have Zabuza killed. Having been redeemed by Naruto, Zabuza kills him first, though is mortally wounded and dies soon afterwards.[ch. 32] He is one of the shinobi resurrected by Kabuto to fight on the Akatsuki side and is defeated, being sealed during a rematch with Kakashi.[ch. 516, 524] In the Japanese anime, his voice actor is Unshō Ishizuka, and his English voice actor is Steven Blum. \\n=== Haku ===\\nHaku (白) is Zabuza Momochi\\'s most faithful follower. Before he started working for Zabuza, Haku lived as an orphan. His father killed his mother when it was discovered that Haku possesses a genetic ability, Hyōton (氷遁, lit. \"Ice Release\"), that allows him to mix wind and water elements to create ice,[ch. 24] which was considered a threat. Haku then killed his father. After wandering from place to place, he was found by Zabuza, who recognized Haku\\'s talents and agreed to take him in as a tool. As a result, Haku becomes unquestioningly protective of and loyal to Zabuza, and only by being useful does he find a purpose in life.[ch. 29] Haku later meets Naruto (who mistakes him for a girl) while he is training, and the two bond over their connections. On this same mission, Haku ultimately gives his life in his mission to save his master from Kakashi\\'s Lightning Blade, becoming the first casualty in the series. This is not in vain, however, as a saddened Naruto uses Haku\\'s death to redeem Zabuza.[ch. 30] Episode 17 of the anime greatly expands on Haku\\'s early life, showing the scene where Haku discovered his powers. Haku is resurrected by Kabuto Yakushi later in Part 2 of the series to fight in the Fourth Shinobi World War until being sealed by the Allied Shinobi Forces.[ch. 516, 524] His voice actress in the Japanese anime is Mayumi Asano, and his English voice actress is Susan Dalian. Mona Marshall voiced Haku as a child. \\n=== Orochimaru === Orochimaru (大蛇丸) is a criminal who served as the principal villain of Part I, having previously affiliated with the Akatsuki. He was a former Hidden Leaf ninja and Hiruzen\\'s student alongside his teammates Jiraiya and Tsunade, who are revered as the Legendary Sannin.[ch. 170] Orochimaru\\'s desire for immortality, so he can learn every jutsu in existence, led him to experimenting on fellow ninja before establishing his own ninja village, the Hidden Sound Village, as his personal laboratory, to continue his work while amassing a personal army to destroy Konoha.[ch. 69] His immortality technique involves transferring his consciousness between different host bodies every few years, with his intent to acquire the body of Sasuke Uchiha being his driving motivations throughout most of the series.[ch. 238] Following end of Part II, through kept under watch by Yamato, Orochimaru renounced his personal war against the Hidden Leaf Village. He has since created Mitsuki.\\nKishimoto emphasized Orochimaru\\'s role as a villain by giving him a \"pasty and sickly\" complexion as part of his theme of distinguishing villains from the protagonists. Because of his different host bodies and the disguises he assumes, a panoply of voice actors are used for Orochimaru; his voice actor for his normal form in the Japanese anime is Kujira, and his corresponding English voice actor is Steven Blum, except in the spin off Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals, where he is voiced by Vic Mignogna. \\n=== Kabuto Yakushi ===\\nKabuto Yakushi (薬師 カブト, Yakushi Kabuto) is a spy who works as Orochimaru\\'s right hand, though he acts on his own whims. As a child with no memory of his past, Kabuto was found on a battlefield by a nun from Konohagakure who raised him before he was recruited by the Foundation as their spy to infiltrate numerous countries and organizations.[ch. 289, 583] But after being labeled a risk to the Foundation for knowing too many secrets, Kabuto becomes Orochimaru\\'s spy after being promised an identity he can call his own.[ch. 584] Using his former affiliations, and infiltrating the Akatsuki, Kabuto gathers intelligence on Orochimaru\\'s behalf; for instance, he participates in the bi-annual Chunin Exams as a Konoha representative to gather information on his fellow participants.[ch. 88] Highly proficient with medical techniques and genetic manipulation, Kabuto devises means to heal wounds by reactivating dead cells to grow new ones, and can form a scalpel with chakra to deal surgical strikes to his opponents.[ch. 164]\\nIn Part II, after his mentor\\'s defeat by Sasuke, Kabuto integrates some of Orochimaru\\'s remains into his body to become powerful enough to not serve anyone again.[ch. 357] Kabuto then masters snake Sage Jutsu while modifying his body with DNA samples of the Sound Five, Jugo, Suigetsu, and Karin to increase his abilities further. After perfecting the Reanimation Jutsu, using it to bring back Madara Uchiha as his personal trump card, Kabuto forces Obito Uchiha into a tenuous alliance with him under the promise that he can have Sasuke upon victory against the Ninja Alliance.[ch. 520] However, during the second day of the Fourth Great Ninja War, Itachi manages to break free of Kabuto\\'s control and force him to end the Reanimation Jutsu with Sasuke\\'s help. The ordeal of being subjected to Itachi\\'s Izanami genjutsu has Kabuto re-evaluate himself and his life, coming to the conclusion that he should save Sasuke. In the war\\'s aftermath, kept under surveillance by the Hidden Leaf, Kabuto returns to run the orphanage where he was held as a kid, together with his adopted brother Urushi. In the Japanese anime, Kabuto is voiced by Nobutoshi Canna, and his English voice actor is Henry Dittman. \\n=== Sound Four === The Sound Four (音隠れの忍四人衆, Otogakure no Shinobi Yonin Shū, lit. \"Hidden Sound Shinobi Four People\", English TV: \"Sound Ninja Four\") are Orochimaru\\'s elite bodyguards. The group was originally known as the \"Sound Five\", but after Kimimaro became bedridden due to his unknown illness, the group resumed calling themselves the Sound Four.[ch. 201] As a group they specialize in barriers, defensive walls, sealing techniques as well as possessing their own individual unique techniques and Curse Marks that increase their strengths.[ch. 184] The group is composed of: Jirobo (次郎坊, Jirōbō), a large, and quick-tempered, man who specializes in absorbing chakra and close-quarters combat.[ch. 187] He is voiced by Kenta Miyake in the Japanese anime, while his English voice actor is Michael Sorich.\\nKidomaru (鬼童丸, Kidōmaru), a six-armed ninja who can produce spider-webs to fight and specialized in ranged combat.[ch. 192] He is voiced by Susumu Chiba in the Japanese anime, while his English voice actor is Peter Lurie.\\nSakon and Ukon (左近 - 右近, Sakon to Ukon) are twin brothers who are the strongest of the Sound Four and count as one member due to their ability to merge their bodies with anyone and kill an opponent at a cellular level.[ch. 203,204] Both Sakon and Ukon are voiced by Shunsuke Sakuya in the Japanese anime, while their English voice actor is Brian Beacock.\\nTayuya (多由也, Tayuya), a female flautist who uses her flute for genjutsu and controlling summoned demons.[ch. 206] She is voiced by Akeno Watanabe in the Japanese anime, while her English voice actress is Kari Wahlgren.\\nKimimaro (君麻呂, Kimimaro), the last of the Kaguya Clan who has his kin\\'s Kekkei Genkai ability to manipulate his bone structure, called the Shikotsumyaku, became the leader after he defeated the entire group in battle. He is voiced by Toshiyuki Morikawa in the Japanese anime with Makoto Tsumura voicing him as a child. His English voice actor is Keith Silverstein with Kari Wahlgren voicing him as a child.\\nThe Sound Four do not become a prominent part of the story until sent by their leader to escort Sasuke Uchiha to him. Even with Kimimaro joining the group to ensure Sasuke\\'s passage to Orochimaru, the Sound Five all died in the process: Jirobo and Kidomaru killed in their respective fights against Chōji Akimichi and Neji Hyūga, Sakon and Ukon taken out by Kankuro as they nearly kill Kiba Inuzuka, Tayuya indirectly killed by Temari as she had the upper hand on Shikamaru Nara, and Kimimaro succumbed to his unknown illness in the midst of his battle against Gaara and Rock Lee.[ch. 184, 217] During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kimimaro is reanimated by Kabuto Yakushi as a pawn to battle against the Allied Shinobi Forces.[ch. 515] In the anime adaptation, unaware that Kabuto brought them back instead of Orochimaru, the Sound Four were also reanimated and were allowed to act on their impulse for revenge against the members of the Sasuke Retrieval group before being defeated. It was also at the time of the war\\'s climax that Kabuto reveals that he assimilated the Sound Five\\'s DNA to access their abilities.[ch. 585] \\n=== Akatsuki === The Akatsuki (暁, lit. \"Dawn\" or \"Daybreak\") is an organization of rogue ninja that serves as the primary antagonistic force of the second part of the Naruto series. It was founded by Yahiko, Nagato and Konan. After Yahiko\\'s death, it was led by Nagato with Obito as his benefactor. The Akatsuki\\'s goal is world peace through the power of the nine Tailed Beasts, with Nagato assuming it would involve mass destruction giving way to a world without war.[ch. 239] To achieve their goal of collecting all nine Tailed Beasts, the Akatsuki recruited several rogue ninjas, including Deidara, Sasori, and Hidan, among other notable Akatsuki members, to join their ranks. The actual goal is for Obito to enact Madara\\'s Project Tsuki no Me (月の眼計画, Tsuki no Me Keikaku, literally \"Eye of the Moon Plan\"), which involves feeding the Tailed Beasts to the Gedo Statue, to revert it into the Ten-Tails with Obito as its Jinchuriki; empowered thus, he would project the Infinite Tsukiyomi on the moon\\'s surface, and bring all life into a utopic illusion. The members of the Akatsuki are ninja who have abandoned their villages, and are considered by their former homes to be S-class criminals, the most powerful and wanted ninja in the Naruto universe. Aside from an attempt by members Itachi Uchiha and Kisame Hoshigaki to capture Kurama (the Nine-Tailed fox sealed within Naruto Uzumaki), the Akatsuki is not prominently featured in Part I.[ch. 143] In Part II, they take a more active role, capturing Gaara and extracting the one-tailed tanuki, Shukaku, from his body, as well as progressively capturing the remaining Tailed Beasts.[ch. 261] Kishimoto called the Akatsuki\\'s members antiheroes as he wished to expand their backgrounds as much as the ones from the series\\' protagonists, contrasting them with other types of villains. \\n==== Obito Uchiha ==== Obito Uchiha (うちは オビト, Uchiha Obito), also known under his alias Tobi (トビ) is the true leader of the Akatsuki and the primary antagonist for most of Part II. As a child during the Third Great Ninja War, being Kakashi\\'s teammate in Team Minato, Obito was similar to Naruto in both wanting to become Hokage and unrequited love for his teammate Rin. When he and Kakashi rescue Rin after she was kidnapped by Hidden Stone Ninja during a mission, Obito\\'s right side got crushed in a landslide. Obito believed his death was certain and had Rin transplant his left Sharingan into Kakashi to replace the latter\\'s original left eye. Obito finds himself saved by Madara and outfitted with Zetsu prosthetics, and is conditioned to become his apprentice, the ninja arranging Obito to witness Rin\\'s death as a casualty of war by a reluctant Kakashi to break his spirit. Coming to the conclusion that he can use the Tailed Beasts to destroy the current reality and create a utopia, Obito takes up Madara\\'s name following the latter\\'s death while masking his voice. Obito would then arrange similar events for Nagato with Yahiko\\'s death to create the current incarnation of the Akatsuki.[ch. 602, 606] Obito serves a behind-the-scenes role throughout the first half of Part II while revealed to have caused tragedy prior to the series, most notably Kurama\\'s attack on the Hidden Leaf as revenge on his sensei Minato for not protecting Rin.[ch. 501] Other than being able to use his right Sharingan to cast Kamui in a fashion that renders him intangible and lets him teleport over great distances, Obito can use Wood Style attacks as his prosthetics possess Hashirama\\'s cells.[ch. 310, 395] \\n==== Zetsu ====\\nZetsu (ゼツ) is the only member of the Akatsuki without a bespoke partner, the only nonhuman member, and Obito\\'s right hand man. Originally, Kaguya created a shadow-like parasitic entity known as Black Zetsu (黒ゼツ, Kuro Zetsu) to manipulate her grandson Indra and his descendants throughout history for one of them to manifest a Rinnegan and free his creator. Black Zetsu succeeds with Madara, whom he deceived into believing that he had created the entity. White Zetsu (白ゼツ, Shiro Zetsu) was originally part of an army that Kaguya was assembling to fend off her kinsmen, consisting of humans mutated into drones after being assimilated by the Ten Tails during Kaguya\\'s previous Infinite Tsukuyomi. Black Zetsu and White Zetsu operate in symbiosis, Black Zetsu occasionally argued with his easygoing host. As White Zetsu is an extension of the Shinju, he can merge into the ground or vegetation to quickly travel to a new location, and use spores to create clones of himself or whoever he touches.[ch. 289] This makes Zetsu not only of use to the Akatsuki as a spy, but also to devour bodies of deceased Akatsuki members or those the organization does not want found.[ch. 255, 261] Another of the White Zetsu retrieved from the Gedo Statue, initially referred to as Guruguru (グルグル) due to the spiral-shaped pattern on his body, later named Tobi (トビ), served as an exosuit for Obito while the youth got used to his new body. After White Zetsu is killed by Sasuke during the Fourth Great Ninja War, Black Zetsu goes into hiding, later merging itself onto Obito to force the human to resurrect Madara.[ch. 575, 656] Ultimately, once the Eye of the Moon Plan runs its course, Black Zetsu reveals his true identity and fuses himself onto Madara to convert the human into a new body for Kaguya to inhabit.[ch. 674] Black Zetsu then reveals his role in the conflict between the Senju and Uchiha, while helping Kaguya fight Naruto and Sasuke. He is eventually ripped away from his creator when Naruto severs Kaguya\\'s arm. As Kaguya is sealed away once more, Black Zetsu is thrown by Naruto into the forming moon so he would not make another attempt to free his creator.[ch. 681, 688, 690] Tobi, having participated in the war by encasing Yamato to access his Wood-Style, before ejecting him once the Infinite Tsukiyomi is cast, crumbles away after the jutsu is canceled, with his former captive the only witness to his death.[ch. 699]\\nAs Kishimoto originally planned the Akatsuki to be a group of individuals with close to no human characteristics, he decided to make Zetsu half black and half white to emphasize his split personality. In the Japanese anime, Zetsu is voiced by Nobuo Tobita, who also voices the Tobi and the White Zetsu Army. In episode 134 of the English adaptation, Black Zetsu is voiced by Michael Sorich and White Zetsu by Brian Beacock, though both in the English Shippuden anime are voiced by Travis Willingham alongside Tobi and the White Zetsu Army. \\n==== Kisame Hoshigaki ====\\nKisame Hoshigaki (干柿 鬼鮫, Hoshigaki Kisame) is a former ninja of Kirigakure and partnered to Itachi Uchiha, having a unique appearance with pale blue skin, a gill-like facial structure, and sharp acute angled triangle teeth. While he was loyal to Kirigakure, Kisame was one of the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist, a group of violent ninja that use particularly large swords in battle. His sword, Samehada (鮫肌, \"Sharkskin\" in Shippuden), is a living weapon covered in scales. Although it was covered in bandage like cloth in the Akatsuki arc (while he was travelling with Itachi Uchiha). That can absorb untold amounts of an opponent\\'s chakra. Only allowing those it sees as worthy to wield it, Samehada can provide the user with the chakra it holds, ensuring him an infinite amount of stamina. Kisame himself has massive amounts of chakra,[ch. 142] and by fusing Samehada into him, Kisame can assume a shark-like form that increases his abilities. In battle, he frequently shapes water into the forms of sharks to damage opponents.[ch. 258] After discarding Samehada when it chose Killer Bee over him, Kisame is decapitated by Killer Bee and the Raikage using Double Lariat. It is later revealed that the decapitation was just a shapeshifting technique performed by Zetsu; the real Kisame having hidden inside Samehada.[ch. 487] He attempts to flee from the ninjas but is defeated by Might Guy and captured. Kisame then commits suicide by summoning sharks and allowing them to eat him, but not before using one of them to steal back the information he had compiled and send it to the Akatsuki.[ch. 508] His voice actor in the Japanese anime is Tomoyuki Dan; in English, he is voiced at first by Michael McConnohie, later by Kirk Thornton. \\n==== Konan ====\\nKonan (小南) is the only female ninja in the Akatsuki. As such, Kishimoto originally wanted her to have an obscene appearance showing more of her bust. Being the partner of Pain, Konan was also a pupil under Jiraiya after she was orphaned as a child by one of Amegakure\\'s many wars and forced to fend for herself. Because she serves under Pain, she is referred to by villagers of Amegakure as \"God\\'s angel\". Under Jiraiya, Konan learned to take advantage of her natural talent with origami, using it as a key component in her battle style.[ch. 373, 449] Konan can divide her body into countless sheets of paper, which she controls and reshapes remotely to scout out an area, form weapons for attack, or create wings that mirror her title. While Konan\\'s abilities are restricted when the paper is wet, since paper will cling and lose its stiffness, she is able to use this weakness to her advantage as she implements explosive tags into her paper clones. After Nagato\\'s death, Konan withdraws her position in the Akatsuki and proclaims loyalty to Naruto.[ch. 372] Later, she is confronted by Obito over the location of Nagato\\'s Rinnegan eyes. She fights him in a suicide assault, but is killed after being forced to reveal Nagato\\'s resting place. She last sees the endless rain of Amegakure stop for the first time.[ch. 510] In the Japanese anime, Konan is voiced by Atsuko Tanaka and in the English anime, her voice actress is Dorothy Elias-Fahn. \\n==== Nagato ==== Nagato (長門), primarily known under the alias of Pain (ペイン, Pein), is the recognized leader of the Akatsuki and partner of Konan, with Obito acting as his benefactor.[ch. 510] The \"Pain\" most often seen in the series is the Deva Path, which is actually Nagato\\'s deceased friend, Yahiko (弥彦), one of six animated corpses collectively known as \"The Six Paths of Pain\" (ペイン六道, Pein Rikudō), all controlled by Nagato and using one sixth of his full power.[ch. 378, 419] The Pain Paths are all outfitted with a number of body piercings that serve as a means for Nagato to control them and to give them a \"more dangerous\" appearance in relation to their name\\'s installation. \\n==== Itachi Uchiha ==== Itachi Uchiha (うちは イタチ, Uchiha Itachi) is a former ninja of Konohagakure and the partner of Kisame Hoshigaki. Though having spent his early youth as the prodigy of the Uchiha clan, Itachi is treated as a villain for much of the series. He is initially portrayed as being solely responsible for the killing of his entire clan and family, sparing only his brother, Sasuke Uchiha, with the explanation that he was testing his abilities.[ch. 224] Around the time of his death his villainous role is downplayed; not only is he revealed to offer help to Obito Uchiha in killing the clan, though it is revealed in part two that he performed the massacre under the orders of Konoha\\'s leadership so as to prevent an Uchiha coup d\\'état.[ch. 400] In the Japanese anime, Itachi\\'s voice actor is Hideo Ishikawa. His first voice actor in the English anime was Skip Stellrecht, who voiced Itachi in episodes 29 and 30, but in all following appearances, he has been voiced by Crispin Freeman. \\n==== Deidara ====\\nDeidara (デイダラ) is a former ninja of Iwagakure, having left the village after bombing it. He was a terrorist bomber-for-hire before Itachi Uchiha forced him to join the Akatsuki. Though he came to embrace the organization, Deidara still holds a grudge against Itachi and all other Uchiha throughout the series, as he feels their Sharingan eyes \"look down on his artwork\".[ch. 359] Upon joining the Akatsuki, he is partnered with Sasori, who is replaced by Tobi after his death. Though he was annoyed by Tobi, Deidara becomes somewhat of a teacher to him, and adopts a genuine care for his well-being.[ch. 366] Both of Deidara\\'s hands have mouths on them that, by infusing clay or other fine-grained minerals with chakra, create \"sculptures\", bombs that explode with varying intensities. Deidara\\'s bombs can take any form he chooses, and from the time of their creation to their detonation, he can animate and control them remotely.[ch. 248] Sasuke Uchiha, Itachi\\'s younger brother, is able to systematically nullify his bombs in combat, and so Deidara transforms himself into a living bomb in a last effort to kill Sasuke and to prove the supremacy of his art, but fails in the attempt.[ch. 363] He is later resurrected by Kabuto for the war against the Shinobi Alliance but is defeated by Kankuro.[ch. 520] His voice actor in the Japanese anime is Katsuhiko Kawamoto. In his cameo appearance in episode 135 of the English adaptation, he is voiced by Quinton Flynn, and in the anime of Shippuden by Roger Craig Smith. \\n==== Hidan ====\\nHidan (飛段) is the immortal, foul-mouthed, and sadomasochistic partner of Kakuzu and a former ninja of Yugakure, the Village Hidden in Boiling Water. He is a member of the Way of Jashin (ジャシン, lit. \"evil god\") religion which worships a deity of the same name and believes that anything less than death and utter destruction in battle is a sin.[ch. 313] His religion\\'s experimentations have led to the creation of his unique abilities; by consuming an opponent\\'s blood and drawing Jashin\\'s triangular symbol on the ground, Hidan can create a link with his opponent. Once this link is created, any damage done to Hidan\\'s body is reflected on his opponent, allowing him to kill them by giving himself fatal injuries. Though his immortality keeps him from dying or suffer any impairment, Hidan feels his victims\\' suffering with an excitement bordering on arousal. [ch. 325] After Hidan used this ability to kill Asuma Sarutobi, Shikamaru Nara fights him to avenge his teacher. Their battle culminates in Hidan being blown up, and Shikamaru burying his still-speaking remains in a forest that the Akatsuki will never be able to reach.[ch. 339] As such, Hidan is no longer considered a member by the rest of the Akatsuki.[ch. 353] In the Japanese version of the anime, Hidan is voiced by Masaki Terasoma. In the English version, he is voiced by Chris Edgerly and in Naruto Shippūden: Clash of Ninja Revolution 3 by Wally Wingert. \\n==== Kakuzu ====\\nKakuzu (角都) is the partner of Hidan and a former ninja of Takigakure, the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls. Kakuzu is motivated by greed, and joins the Akatsuki to seek out valuable bounties. However, his extreme temperament and fits of rage leading to his eventual murder of whomever he was partnered with resulted in his pairing with the immortal Hidan.[ch. 322] When Kakuzu still lived in his village, he was given a very important mission: assassinate Hashirama Senju, the First Hokage. As the strongest shinobi of his time, Hashirama was far too strong for Kakuzu, and the mission failed with Kakuzu barely escaping with his life. Kakuzu returned to his village, and, despite the overwhelming danger and risk he faced, he was dishonoured and severely punished. Gaining a violent hatred for his village because of this unfair treatment, Kakuzu escaped from prison and, in vengeance, stole his village\\'s forbidden techniques, and murdered the village elders (carving out their hearts), becoming a rogue ninja in the process. Kakuzu\\'s body is composed of a large number of black threads, allowing him to reattach any body part, his or another, back onto its owner. The threads are also capable of piercing flesh, which Kakuzu uses to remove the still-beating hearts of his opponents and integrate their hearts into his body to extend his life indefinitely. Kakuzu can store up to four spare hearts in animal masks that are sewn to his back, which can be detached during combat situations to shoot elemental blasts at his opponents, and quickly recalled to his body if he needs a replacement heart.[ch. 336] Kakuzu\\'s hearts are systematically destroyed soon after his introduction by a group of Konohagakure ninja. After Naruto Uzumaki leaves his final heart on the brink of failure, Kakuzu is easily finished off by Kakashi.[ch. 342] After being resurrected by Kabuto, he is sent out to participate in the war until being sealed. In the Japanese anime, Kakuzu\\'s Japanese voice actor is Takaya Hashi and in the English version he is voiced by Fred Tatasciore. \\n==== Sasori ====\\nSasori (蠍), primarily known as \"Sasori of the Red Sand\" (赤砂の蠍, Akasuna no Sasori), is a former ninja of Sunagakure and partner of Deidara. When he was a child, Sasori\\'s parents were killed by Sakumo Hatake, also known as the White Fang of Konoha, leaving him in the care of his grandmother, Chiyo, who taught Sasori the art of puppetry to cheer him up after his loss, which he refined to fit his needs over the years. However, motivated by his desire to make works that last forever, Sasori secretly devised a way to convert the corpses of humans into puppets, allowing him to use any ninja abilities they possessed for himself. Leaving Sunagakure in his teenage years, Sasori later kidnapped the Third Kazekage, transforming him into a puppet and using him as his main weapon.[ch. 267] Sasori\\'s desire was to become art, so he converted his own body into a puppet, which essentially gives him eternal life and allows him to control hundreds of puppets at once.[ch. 271] After joining the Akatsuki, Sasori was paired with Orochimaru, and after his desertion, was teamed with Deidara, who looks up to him and his artistic knowledge with reverence.[ch. 248][ch. 263] In the Akatsuki, Sasori spent much time hidden inside Hiruko, a human puppet who served as both weapon and armour, which he adorned with the Akatsuki\\'s robe. After he and Deidara kidnap Gaara, Sasori ends up fighting Sakura and Chiyo, resulting in the destruction of his heart, the only part of his humanity he kept when converting himself to a puppet, resulting in his death. Before dying, he tells Sakura about his rendezvous with one of Orochimaru\\'s henchmen who had been working for him as a spy.[ch. 464] After being resurrected by Kabuto, Sasori fights Kankuro, who convinces him to be at peace with himself. Sasori comes to terms with his life and is able to pass on and rest in peace. In the Japanese anime, Sasori is voiced by Akiko Yajima as a child and by Takahiro Sakurai as an adult. In the English version he is voiced by Kari Wahlgren as a child and as an adult he is voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch. His scorpion-like puppet body, Hiruko, is voiced by Yutaka Aoyama in the Japanese version and in the English version by JB Blanc. \\n=== Madara Uchiha ===\\n \\nMadara Uchiha (うちは マダラ, Uchiha Madara) is one of the co-founders of the Hidden Leaf Village along with Hashirama Senju, the two later revealed to be reincarnations of their clans\\' founding ancestors Indra and Asura prior to Sasuke and Naruto.[ch. 385, 671] Madara is a cynical and vengeful man who holds grudges against the Senju Clan for slaughtering his brothers in the War. He is very arrogant about his immense battle prowess. Though he was a childhood friend of Hashirama amidst the conflicts of their respective clan, their friendship ends as a result of the war. As the leader of the Uchiha clan, Madara\\'s overuse of Mangekyo Sharingan blinds him, forcing him to take the eyes of his late younger brother Izuna. This allows Madara to use his newly awakened Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan to continue the ongoing war between the Uchiha and the Senju.[ch. 386] In later years, Hashirama comes forth with a peace offering between the two clans. Though he agrees to have peace with his former rival, Madara feels he would never be accepted by the Senju and loses hope in Hashirama. While working towards this goal, Madara captures Kurama the Nine-Tails and uses him in a scheme to destroy Konoha.[ch. 399, 621] Madara is believed to have been killed by Hashirama\\'s hand, but he survives and goes into hiding while taking a blood sample of Hashirama with him to awake his Rinnegan.[ch. 560] During this time, Madara takes Obito Uchiha as his agent and transplants his Rinnegan into Nagato to be preserved for his eventual revival years later.[ch. 605]\\nDuring most of the Naruto series, Obito uses the name of \"Madara\", until Kabuto Yakushi finds the real Madara Uchiha and reanimates him to force Obito into an alliance. Despite their agreement, Kabuto summons Madara to fight against the Shinobi Alliance.[ch. 562] Madara manages to sever his connection to Kabuto\\'s technique by using the hand signs of the Reanimation Jutsu, defeating most of the Ninja Alliance forces. Madara manages to fully resurrect as planned by sacrificing Obito, becoming the Ten Tails\\'s host once he regains one of his Rinnegan.[ch. 658, 669, 673] After regaining his other eye, Madara is able to complete the Eye of the Moon Plan before finding himself betrayed by Black Zetsu who proceeds to turn him into a vessel for Kaguya\\'s spirit. [ch. 658, 669, 673] Though freed upon Kaguya being resealed, the ordeal placed a regretful Madara on the verge of death and dies being able to finally make peace with Hashirama. In the Japanese anime, Madara (and Obito in his Madara guise) is voiced by Naoya Uchida while Gou Inoue voices him as a child. In the English version, Madara\\'s voice is supplied by Neil Kaplan, with Xander Mobus voicing him as a child. \\n=== Ōtsutsuki Clan ===\\nThe Ōtsutsuki Clan (大筒木一族, Ōtsutsuki Ichizoku) are ancient clan of horned celestial beings of unknown origin who spent eons seeking out worlds that cultivate with Divine Trees (神樹, Shinju), alien plants that drain a world\\'s resources to produce chakra fruit (チャクラの実, Chakura no Mi) while some are revered by a populace as a sacred symbol. The main family Ōtsutsuki clan would harvest the fruit to prolong their lives while reducing the host planet into a dead world before seeking for another world to plant a new Divine Tree there. Kaguya Ōtsutsuki\\'s descendants produced a branch family which further branched out into the Senju, Uzumaki, Uchiha, and Hyuga Clans. \\n==== Kaguya Ōtsutsuki ====\\nKaguya Ōtsutsuki (大筒木 カグヤ, Ōtsutsuki Kaguya) is a member of the main family of the Ōtsutsuki clan who is the central underlying antagonist of the Naruto series. Betraying her partner Isshiki Ōtsutsuki after they planted a Divine Tree on the world, Kaguya decided to keep the world for herself and ate the Divine Tree\\'s fruit to awaken her Rinne Sharigan and subject the world to the Infinite Tsukuyomi to end all conflict.[ch. 646] While Kaguya was revered as the \"Rabbit Goddess\" (卯の女神, Usagi no Megami), Kaguya was consumed by her power as eventually lost trust in humanity while converting humans assimilated by the Divine Tree into her personal army of White Zetsu as a defense against her kinsmen. This and the other horrifying acts that Kaguya resulted in the then-powerless people to denounce her as a \"Demon\" (鬼, Oni). Later learning that some of her chakra passed on into her sons, Hagoromo and Hamura, Kaguya attempts to reclaim that power by merging into the Divine Tree and regress it into the Ten-Tails (十尾, Jūbi). Hagoromo, aided by his brother Hamura, managed to defeat the monster and seal him in his body, becoming the first jinchūriki. Shortly before dying, the Sage decided to divide the demon\\'s chakra into nine parts and, through a technique known as \"perfect Izanagi\" of Yin-Yang, he gave birth to the bodies of the nine tailed beasts into which she infused all of her mother\\'s chakra her. She eventually sealed the Ten-Tails\\' soulless body with the Chibaku Tensei, trapping him in an enormous mass of rocks, which would later be known as the Moon. But Kaguya created Black Zetsu at the last second to orchestrate her return by influencing Hagoromo\\'s eldest son Indra and the Uchiha Clan. Having successfully manipulated Madara Uchiha into eventually casting the Infinite Tsukuyomi while having the Ten-Tails corpse absorbed by the Uchiha, Black Zetsu betrays Madara and converts him into a vessel for Kaguya to inhabit. From there, deeming Naruto and Sasuke a threat because they are the current reincarnations of her grandsons and because of their resemblance to her own children, Kaguya takes Team 7 and Obito into her dimensional realms to kill them there. But after being overpowered by Naruto and Sasuke with Sakura preventing her escape, Kaguya is resealed with the tailed beasts and Madara extracted from her body.[ch. 646, 647] Kaguya is voiced by Mami Koyama in Japanese and by Cissy Jones in the English dub. \\n==== Toneri Ōtsutsuki ====\\nToneri Ōtsutsuki (大筒木 トネリ, Ōtsutsuki Toneri) is the antagonist of The Last: Naruto the Movie, a descendant of Hamura Ōtsutsuki whose family left the world and live on the moon to maintain the imprisonment of the Gedo Statue.

Due to her curious nature, she attempted to study Jigen\\'s heart, at which point Jigen removed a part of her brain and exiled her. While her body breaks down as she is held in stasis, she uses a puppet and genjutsu to capture people and place them in a genjutsu world of traps, to somehow regain her desire to live through them, since she also participates under a false identity, Yatsume.

After her friend Dan Katō and brother Nawaki Senju die in pursuit of their dreams to become Hokage, she loses faith in the title and the concept of dreams. She regains her faith in both after meeting Naruto Uzumaki, who consistently overcomes any obstacle in his own dreams of being Hokage.[ch. 172] As a result, Tsunade accepts the position of Fifth Hokage (五代目火影, Godaime Hokage) to protect Konohakagure on behalf of everyone she has loved,[ch. 169] also later taking Sakura as her apprentice, much like Orochimaru with Sasuke and Jiraiya with Naruto. By the end of the series, Tsunade retires at the end of the Fourth Great Ninja War and bestows the Hokage title to Kakashi. She is last seen in the epilogue attending a meeting with other recent Kage that have also retired.\\nDespite the importance of her position, Tsunade tends to laze around and avoid her everyday duties, instead leaving them for her assistant Shizune. She does however take her role very seriously in situations where Konoha is in danger, and throughout Part II leads the village in combating the Akatsuki.[ch. 238] Tsunade is a compulsive gambler with terrible luck, though with a rare winning streak perceived by her as a bad omen. Despite her odd personality, Tsunade is a highly talented medical ninja who can heal injuries that most others would consider incurable, and also possesses superhuman strength that allows her to reduce buildings to rubble. The pinnacle of her skills is the Creation Rebirth jutsu and its derived technique, the Strength of a Hundred Technique, which she taught to her disciple Sakura. This way, both Tsunade and Sakura use mitotic regeneration to make them nearly unkillable in battle. In the Japanese anime, Tsunade\\'s voice actress is Masako Katsuki, and her English voice actress is Debi Mae West. In some of the video games, however, her English voice actress is Mary Elizabeth McGlynn. \\n=== Jiraiya === Jiraiya (自来也) was a Konohagakure ninja, being not only Naruto\\'s teacher but also his father\\'s teacher. Kishimoto has commented that out of all master-pupil relationships he has created in the Naruto series, the bond between Naruto and Jiraiya is his favorite, noting that it makes drawing them \"worthwhile\". As a child, Jiraiya was under the tutelage of Hiruzen Sarutobi, along with his teammates, Tsunade and Orochimaru.[ch. 170] Jiraiya is known throughout the Naruto world as the \"Toad Sage\" (蝦蟇仙人, Gama Sennin) due to his toad-related jutsu and knowledge of Sage Jutsu. Prior to Naruto, Jiraiya also trained other pupils like Minato and Nagato due to a prophecy he heard that his pupil would be great man. Although still affiliated with Konoha, Jiraiya is usually traveling to watch over potential threats to his home. Jiraiya\\'s personality is openly lecherous, proudly describes himself as a \"super pervert\" while authoring a series of best-selling adult romance novels.[ch. 91] He also wrote the epic \"Tale of the Gutsy Ninja\", with Naruto named after its protagonist. During Part I, he takes Naruto as his student, and returns him to Konoha in Part II before leaving to investigate the Akatsuki. However, finding Nagato leading the organization, Jiraiya dies fighting his former student\\'s Paths of Pain while sending a message to the village, believing to have done enough for Naruto.[ch. 245] In the Japanese anime, Jiraiya is voiced by Hōchū Ōtsuka, with Toru Nara voicing him as a child. His English voice actor is David Lodge, with Brad MacDonald voicing him as a child; Richard Cansino and Wally Wingert also voice him in some video games. \\n=== Anko Mitarashi ===\\nAnko Mitarashi (みたらしアンコ, Mitarashi Anko) is a kunoichi from Konohagakure and a classmate of Team Minato\\'s. She was assigned to a team under the tutelage of Orochimaru. The two became fond of each other, and Orochimaru ultimately decided to give Anko some of his research. However, this resulted in Anko being the only survivor of ten Cursed Seal subjects, and also develop various snake-like abilities.[ch. 50] After Orochimaru abandoned his village, Anko blamed herself and made it her personal goal to eliminate him. At the start of the series, she is a loud, brash tokubetsu jonin and the proctor of the second part of the Chunin Exams. After prematurely arriving to take the examinees to the Forest of Death, she ends up frightening Naruto when he complains about her \"exaggerations\" of the forest.[ch. 45] She also fights Orochimaru in the forest alone when she discovers he is in there. During Part II, Anko is sent by the Allied Shinobi Forces to find and locate Kabuto. However, Kabuto ends up defeating her in battle, and uses her Cursed Seal to fuel his Reanimation Jutsu while she is unconscious. Taka later finds her and uses her Cursed Seal to release Orochimaru, causing the Seal to be cured. In the epilogue, Anko is an instructor at the Academy, having become rather fat.[ch. 700] In Japanese, Anko is voiced by Takako Honda. In the English dub, she is voiced by Julianne Buescher until Episode 169, when Laura Bailey takes over; Anko is also voiced by Kari Wahlgren in Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3 and is also voiced by Cherami Leigh in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. \\n=== Shizune === Shizune (シズネ) is a Konohagakure ninja introduced in the series as Tsunade\\'s assistant. She leaves Konohagakure with Tsunade after the death of her boyfriend Dan Katō, and over the years, Tsunade teaches her medical techniques. Many of the attacks she uses in the series are poison-based, including using concealed poisoned needles or emitting toxic gas from her mouth.[ch. 166] In Part II of the series, Shizune\\'s concern for details causes her to question Tsunade\\'s judgment, creating interference with Tsunade\\'s plans and temporarily straining the relationship between the two.[ch. 282] During Pain\\'s attack on Konohagakure, Shizune is briefly killed when her soul is stripped away as the Human Path interrogates her about Naruto\\'s whereabouts,[ch. 429] though she is revived at the end of the invasion.[ch. 449] She continues to serve as the Hokage\\'s personal assistant well over into Naruto\\'s leadership as the Seventh Hokage in the series epilogue.[ch. 449] In the Japanese anime, her voice actress is Keiko Nemoto, and her English voice actress is Megan Hollingshead. \\n=== Sai ===\\nSai (サイ) is a ninja who joins Team Kakashi/ Team 7 in Part II, carefully designed by Kishimoto to stand out as Sasuke\\'s replacement by having the two look similar. A member of \"The Foundation\" since he was a child, Sai has been trained to not possess or desire any type of emotion or camaraderie, even after he killed his surrogate brother Shin under Danzo\\'s diabolical orders. He consequently gives people labels based on their status, and his label of Sasuke as a traitor antagonizes Naruto and Sakura. After the two discover his past and warm up to him, however, he begins to crave bonds with other people, which becomes his primary goal in the series.[ch. 303] Sai\\'s attempts to form bonds turn can be humorous as he tries giving pet names to others; however, he often says what he actually thinks of a person, resulting with him choosing names such as \"fatso\" for Choji and \"ugly\" for Sakura. He eventually learns from his mistakes and attempts the opposite approach by calling Ino \"beautiful\", causing Ino to fall for him.[ch. 312] When not making an attempt to bond with others, Sai spends his time painting and drawing, and has produced thousands of works, although he doesn\\'t name any of them. His artistic talents extend to his choice of attacks in battles, as he can infuse chakra with his inking brush to make his drawings come to life.[ch. 283] In the series epilogue, Sai ends up marrying Ino Yamanaka and together they have a son, Inojin.[ch. 700] Sai\\'s voice actor is Satoshi Hino in the Naruto: Shippūden anime, and his English voice actor is Benjamin Diskin except in Rock Lee and his Ninja Pals, where he is voiced by Lucien Dodge. \\n=== Yamato ===\\nYamato (ヤマト) is introduced during Part II of the series as an ANBU member who becomes a substitute leader in Team Kakashi.[ch. 285] \"Yamato\" is not his real name, rather a codename assigned for the purposes of joining Team Kakashi.[ch. 317] Unlike Kakashi, who was his senior in the ANBU and referred to him as Tenzo (テンゾウ, Tenzō), Yamato believes ninja should be able to look after themselves to the point of leaving behind any he sees as a hindrance.[ch. 298] During his childhood, Yamato was abducted by Orochimaru and experimented upon in an attempt to replicate Hashirama\\'s Wood Style. In the anime, the ordeal erased Yamato\\'s memories as he was taken in by Danzo to serve as a Root operative under the code name Kinoe (甲). After meeting Kakashi, Kinoe would leave Root and join the Anbu as Tenzo.\\nAfter Kakashi Hatake was wounded during his team\\'s mission to rescue Gaara from the Akatsuki, Tsunade places Yamato in Team Kakashi under the cover of acting leader so he can use his Wood Style whenever the need to suppress Kurama\\'s influence over Naruto arises.[ch. 291] For possessing Hashirama\\'s DNA, Yamato gets captured by Kabuto to strengthen the White Zetsu army for the Fourth Great Ninja War. Yamato is eventually revealed to have been contained by the body of the White Zetsu known as Guruguru, until the altered human ejects him once Madara casts the Infinite Tsukiyomi.[ch. 676] In Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring, Yamato is among the ninja assigned to keep tabs on Orochimaru. In the anime, Yamato is voiced by Rikiya Koyama in the Japanese version. In the English version, he was voiced by Troy Baker, with Matthew Mercer taking over the role since Episode 230; however, Baker reprises the role in Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4. \\n=== Killer Bee ===\\nKiller Bee (キラービー, Kirābī) is a ninja from the village of Kumogakure and the Jinchuriki of Gyūki — the Eight-Tails.[ch. 411] He is also the adoptive brother of A, the current Raikage, and as such, is expected to be the guardian of the village.[ch. 541] In battle, he uses its great strength to increase the lethality of his professional wrestling-styled attacks,[ch. 413] something Kishimoto\\'s former editor proposed. He is also a talented swordsman, capable of using up to seven swords at once and to execute attacks unpredictable enough to render Sasuke\\'s Sharingan useless.[ch. 411] When the Akatsuki attacks him, he pretends to be captured to escape at the cost of losing some of Gyūki\\'s chakra and pursue a career as an enka music singer.[ch. 419][ch. 537] However, Killer Bee is brought back to Kumogakure, playing a role in teaching Naruto how to control Kurama\\'s power. He also becomes Naruto\\'s primary partner in the war against the Akatsuki after gaining his brother\\'s approval to fight alongside him, eventually losing Gyūki to Madara.[ch. 544] However, Killer Bee survived the extracting by holding on to a piece of Gyūki\\'s tentacle and becomes the Eight Tails Jinchuriki again in the aftermath of the war. In the Boruto anime series, Killer Bee was attacked by Otsutsuki clansmen with his fate currently unknown following the Eight Tails chakra being extracted from him. Despite the difficulties in making his lines, as he always speaks in rhymes, Kishimoto wishes to make him a rich character. His voice actor in the Japanese anime is Hisao Egawa, and his English voice actor is Catero Colbert. \\n=== Hagoromo Otsutsuki ===\\nHagoromo Ōtsutsuki (大筒木ハゴロモ, Ōtsutsuki Hagoromo), known as \"The Sage of Six Paths\" (六道仙人, Rikudō Sennin), and his twin brother Hamura are the sons of Kaguya. Having unintentionality inherited fragments of the Shinju\\'s chakra while in their mother\\'s womb, Hagoromo and Hamura ended up fighting Kaguya upon learning the truth of the utopia they were born into. After the brothers defeated Kaguya following her transformation into the Ten-Tails, Hagoromo become the first jinchūriki and use the chakra to establish a practice known as ninshu, which eventually evolved into ninjutsu to his dismay, Hagoromo started a family while considering an heir to his legacy between his sons, Asura and Indra. While Indra was naturally gifted and self-reliant, Hagoromo ultimately decided on Asura due to his ability to befriend others and peaceful ideologies. This would cause a rift between the brothers, Hagoromo unaware of Black Zetsu\\'s role in turning Indra against his family. Hagoromo later uses the last of his strength to create the Tailed Beasts before passing away and seal the body of the Ten-Tails into the moon. Despite his death, Hagoromo\\'s spirit observed Asura and Indra throughout their reincarnations, including Hashirama and Madara, before his sons\\' current incarnations as Naruto and Sasuke. During the Fourth Great Ninja War, realizing Madara\\'s intentions, Hagoromo intervenes to give Naruto and Sasuke the power to defeat Kaguya and later bringing Team 7 back from Kaguya\\'s dimension with the deceased Kage. Hagoromo eventually departs as Naruto and Sasuke proceed in their final duel. Hagoromo is voiced by Mitsutaka Tachikawa in Japanese and Michael McConnohie in the English dub. \\n=== Himawari Uzumaki ===\\nHimawari Uzumaki (うずまき ヒマワリ, Uzumaki Himawari) is the second child of Naruto Uzumaki and Hinata Hyuga, inheriting the latter\\'s hair along with her father\\'s blue eyes. She also inherits her maternal family\\'s Byakugan, which allows her to do the Gentle Fist technique capable of blocking the target\\'s chakra points with one hit, although she only activates them when she is upset. Like her mother, Himawari is kind-hearted and is fond of her brother Boruto even though he has a fear of her, though she has a temper like her late-paternal grandmother that terrifies Boruto if she is pushed too hard. One such moment resulted in Himawari accidentally knocking Naruto out before his inauguration as Hokage with Kurama developing a phobia of her from the near-death ordeal and giving Haruto Syngenesophobia. She visits Neji\\'s grave with her mother during the epilogue. [ch. 700] In the Japanese version, Himawari is voiced by Yūki Kuwahara in The Last: Naruto the Movie and Saori Hayami in Boruto: Naruto the Movie.

Kagura is voiced by Keisuke Kōmoto in Japanese and Bryce Papenbrook in the English dub. \\n== Other characters == \\n=== Sunagakure === \\n==== Chiyo ====\\nChiyo (チヨ) was an elder advisor to Sunagakure introduced at the start of Part II, initially mistrustful of other ninja villages because of the Second and Third Great Ninja Wars. During those wars, she played a role in formal treaties while strengthening Sunagakure\\'s military might with her knowledge of poisons despite her efforts being nullified by Tsunade\\'s antidotes. As a skilled puppeteer, Chiyo takes Sasori in after his parents died at the hands of Kakashi Hatake\\'s father, and teaches him everything she knows before his departure. When Gaara is captured by the Akatsuki, Chiyo joins Team Kakashi to rescue the Kazekage. Confronting Sasori, Chiyo is able to kill her grandson with help from Sakura Haruno. Despite their efforts, Gaara dies before they can rescue him.[ch. 275, 278] Touched by the genuine bond formed between Sunagakure and Konoha, Chiyo gives up her life to revive Gaara, hoping that the relationship of peace might be continued.[ch. 280] However, by the Fourth Great Ninja War, Chiyo is brought back by Kabuto\\'s Reanimation Jutsu to fight against the combined Ninja army. She is eventually put back to rest after Itachi cancels the technique.

A fierce man with extreme conviction, A\\'s only somewhat soft spot is his love for his younger adoptive brother, Killer Bee. He is the son of the Third Raikage, groomed especially to succeed him, and believes that ninja must always show resolve even when they are defeated. He is also considered by many to be the fastest ninja in the world following Minato\\'s death, up until when Naruto is able to dodge his attacks. A would later fight in the Third Shinobi World War, where he would frequently fight with Minato Namikaze, only for all of their battles to create stalemates.[ch. 542] After Killer Bee is seemingly abducted by Taka, A resolves to kill Sasuke and ridicules Naruto for trying to defend him. He and Sasuke later fight at the Five Kage Summit, during which A loses his left arm;[ch. 464] after learning the truth about Killer Bee, he helps him defeat Kisame.[ch. 473] A eventually becomes the Supreme Commander of the Allied Shinobi Forces, and after allowing Naruto and Killer Bee to fight in the war once they defeat him, fights and loses against Madara. Sometime between the war\\'s end and the series epilogue, he steps down as Raikage and is succeeded by Darui. A is voiced by Hideaki Tezuka in Japanese and by Beau Billingslea in English. \\n==== Darui ====\\nDarui (ダルイ) is a Kumogakure ninja who serves as one of the bodyguards for the Fourth Raikage during the Kage Summit. In contrast to his master, he is easygoing and tends to apologize, which the Raikage chastises him for. He is taught by the Third Raikage on the arts of black lightning, shaping it in the form of black panther, and also possesses the Storm Style kekkei genkai, a mixture of lightning and water elements that forms flowing lightning. During the Fourth Ninja War, Darui leads the First Division specializing in mid-range battles. Sometime between the war\\'s end and the series epilogue, he becomes the Fifth Raikage (五代目雷影, Godaime Raikage). During Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Darui goes to the Leaf Village to oversee the Chunnin Exams.

She is greatly worried by her teacher\\'s disappearance following his fight with Taka and visits Konohagakure with her team in order to find him. A passionate and bold young woman, she quickly becomes involved in an altercation with Team Kakashi, blaming them for befriending and defending Sasuke Uchiha. She even proceeds to brutally punch Naruto in the face repeatedly after he allows her to do so as compensation for not giving up information on Sasuke. Karui is assigned as part of the Second Division during the Fourth Ninja War. Sometime after the war ends, she moves to Konohagakure and marries Choji Akimichi, giving birth to their daughter Chocho, who is an academy student in the series epilogue.[ch. 700] Kauri is voiced by Yuka Komatsu in the Japanese anime.

She possesses two kekkei genkai: the Lava Style, a combination of fire and earth elements that allows her to spit lava, and Vapor Style, which mixes fire and water to create corrosive mist. She is apparently relatively new to the position and does not remember the previous leadership, which conducted witch hunts against kekkei genkai users like her, fondly. During the Kage Summit, Mei acts rather dodgy when asked about rumors that the Akatsuki formed in her village, and when she finds out Danzo is capable of mind control she suspects him of using it on the previous Mizukage. She manages to nearly kill Sasuke during the meeting and initially helps guard the daimyō of the Shinobi Countries during the preparation for the Fourth Ninja War. During the war, Mei fights the revived Madara Uchiha with the other Kages, though despite their impressive teamwork, they still end up losing to Madara\\'s might. Years after the war comes to an end and during some point at the epilogue, Mei passes down her title to her former bodyguard Chōjūrō. Despite being a beautiful woman in her thirties, she is never married, and the status of being one pains her. She is voiced by Yurika Hino in the Japanese anime, and by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn in the English adaptation. \\n==== Chojuro ====\\nChojuro (長十郎, Chōjūrō) is one of Mei Terumi\\'s bodyguards, with the other being Ao.

Chojuro frequently annoys Ao because he stutters and seems to lack self-confidence. After accompanying the Mizukage to the Kage Summit, he helps her guard the daimyō of the Shinobi Countries, and is able to gain enough self-confidence to help Naruto defeat Black Zetsu. He later becomes the Sixth Mizukage (六代目水影, Rokudaime Mizukage) sometime after the war. In the Japanese anime, he is voiced by Kouki Miyata, while Brian Beacock provides his voice in the English adaptation. \\n==== Ao ====\\nAo (青) is one of Mei Terumi\\'s bodyguards. He is a middle-aged ninja who wears an eyepatch on his right eye, a Byakugan he acquired from a main house Hyuga, and is often critical of Chōjūrō\\'s indecisiveness due to his upbringing during Hidden Mist Village\\'s \"Blood Mist\" days. When Mifune suggests Danzo Shimura to lead the inter-village effort against the Akatsuki, Ao reveals his Byakugan to confirm that Danzo\\'s eye and arm belonged to Shisui Uchiha, whom he fought and aware of the Uchiha\\'s ability to covertly manipulate others. Ao then goes after Danzo\\'s group when they flee during Taka\\'s attack, only to saved by Mei and Chōjūrō when he fell into a trap that Danzo\\'s men set up in an attempt to retrieve his Byakugan. Ao serves in the Allied Shinobi Forces as captain of the Sensor Division stationed in the Shinobi Alliance Headquarters in Kumogakure, barely surviving the Ten Tails\\' Tailed Beast Bomb when it obliterated their base. Later revealed to have survived in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, his body has been augmented with Shinobi-Ware prosthetics that include a Type-3 Shinobi Gauntlet replacing his left forearm. Ao had become a sleeper agent for the Kara. He engaged Team Konohamaru and Katasuke, using one of the latter\\'s inventions to kill Mugino. A revenge-driven Boruto manages to outwit and overpower Ao, sparing the man\\'s life, and making him return to the Shinobi side. Ao ends up sacrificing himself to save Boruto from being crushed by Kashin Koji\\'s Boiler Toad. He is voiced by Tadahisa Saizen in the Japanese anime, while Steven Blum voices him in the English adaptation. \\n==== Gengetsu Hozuki ====\\nGengetsu Hozuki (鬼灯 幻月, Hōzuki Gengetsu) was the Second Mizukage (二代目水影, Nidaime Mizukage) of Kirigakure. A very tall mustached man with large poofy hair, curious way of dressing and with no eyebrows, he was laid back and very charismatic leader concerned with the welfare of his village.[ch. 546] He loathed the Second Tsuchikage and their final confrontation with each other resulted in their mutual deaths.[ch. 525] Gengetsu is brought back to life by Kabuto\\'s resurrection technique to face the Shinobi Alliance in the Fourth Ninja War. Like other members of the Hozuki clan, he mastered hydrification technique, which manifests itself as an oily, water like substance.[ch. 548] He is voiced by Hideyuki Umezu in the Japanese anime, while Jamieson Price voices him in the English adaptation. \\n=== Iwagakure === \\n==== Onoki ====\\nOnoki (オオノキ, Ōnoki) was the Third Tsuchikage (三代目土影, Sandaime Tsuchikage) of the Iwagakure, the grandson of the First Tsuchikage Ishikawa, and a protege of his predecessor Mu with longest reign as Kage that allowed him to personally meet many figures long dead in the present, including Madara Uchiha.[ch. 469] He possesses the Particle Style, a kekkei tota that combines Fire, Earth, and Wind elements to create three-dimensional shapes capable of disintegrating anything it touches, as well as the ability to alter gravity, enabling him flight. He is very proud, despite his frailty,[ch. 454] and shows little respect to those much younger than him. During the Kage Summit, he admitted to have frequently hired Akatsuki members.[ch. 458][ch. 459] While Onoki justify hiring the Akatsuki as necessary in protecting his village during its demilitarization, both it and his advanced age kept him from being named leader of the Shinobi Alliance though Sasuke\\'s intrusion and Gaara\\'s conduct cause Onoki to regain some of more noble traits from his youth. Later, he goes out to find Kabuto and prevent him from finding Killer Bee and Naruto and succeeds in protecting them. Throughout the war, Onoki\\'s techniques proved instrumental in keeping Alliance members alive and he becomes the de facto leader in the assault against the real Madara Uchiha. Years later, Onoki retires due to his failing health and passes down his title to his granddaughter, Kurotsuchi. In the Boruto series, following an attack on his village by a rogue ninja a decade after the Fourth Great Ninja War that took the life of his grandson Kozuchi, Onoki began to develop the Akuta as a defense force to keep people safe and unharmed. He continued perfecting the process after receiving a White Zetsu\\'s remains, improving on the Akuta while creating Fabrications like his partial clone son Kū as he orchestrated Mitsuki\\'s abduction to refine the process. But upon seeing the extent the Fabrications would go to see his ideals realized, Onoki helps Boruto stop the artificial humans at the cost of his life. Onoki is voiced by Tomomichi Nishimura in the Japanese anime and Steven Blum in the English adaptation. \\n==== Kurotsuchi ====\\nKurotsuchi (黒ツチ) is Onoki\\'s granddaughter and his bodyguard during the Kage Summit. She is a kunoichi who favors her village\\'s best interests greatly, even once advising Onoki to kill Naruto and Killer Bee so as to avoid seeing them fall to the Akatsuki. She was also an acquaintance of Deidara before his defection to the Akatsuki. Kurotsuchi participates in the Fourth Ninja War, serving in the Second Division under her father, Kitsuchi. She survives the war and becomes the Fourth Tsuchikage (四代目土影, Yondaime Tsuchikage) by the series epilogue, replacing her ailing grandfather. She is voiced by Hana Takeda in the Japanese anime and Laura Bailey in the English adaptation and is also voiced by Cherami Leigh in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. \\n==== Akatsuchi ====\\nAkatsuchi (赤ツチ) is one of Onoki\\'s bodyguards accompanying him for the Kage Summit. He is a portly and jovial man who is nevertheless loyal and dedicated to his master. Despite his big size, he moves fast and excels in Earth Style, using it to form golems. Like Kurotsuchi, he was a friend of Deidara before his defection to the Akatsuki. Akatsuchi participates in and survives the Fourth Ninja War, continuing to serve as the Tsuchikage\\'s personal bodyguard well over into Kurotsuchi\\'s reign. He is voiced by Kenta Miyake in Japanese and by Kyle Hebert in English. \\n==== Mu ====\\nMu (無, Mū) was the Second Tsuchikage (二代目土影, Nidaime Tsuchikage) of Iwagakure. \\n=== Kurama ===\\nKurama (九喇嘛), often called the Nine-Tails (九尾の妖狐, Kyūbi no Yōko, lit. Nine-Tailed Fox), is the most powerful of the Tailed Beasts. Used by Madara in his attempt to wipe out Konohagakure at the time of its foundation, Kurama is defeated and sealed within Hashirama\\'s wife and then transferred to Kushina Uzumaki two generations later. Through Obito\\'s scheme, Kurama is released and attacks Konohagakure before being stopped by the Fourth Hokage Minato Namikaze, who seals the fox\\'s Yin half within himself. Following this, Minato and Kushina sacrifice themselves to seal the weakened Yang Kurama within their son, Naruto Uzumaki, twelve years before the series\\' start.[ch. 1][ch. 500] Throughout the series, Naruto tries to harness Kurama\\'s immense chakra to perform several jutsu that would normally be impossible for a shinobi of his age.[ch. 95] But Naruto soon learns that relying too much on Kurama\\'s power would allow the fox to impose its will over its host to the point of breaking the seal. Naruto eventually takes control of the fox\\'s chakra with help from an imprint of Kushina.[ch. 499] During Naruto\\'s fight against Obito, seeing its host\\'s resolve to save the other Tailed Beasts, Kurama befriends Naruto by allowing him to achieve Tailed Beast Mode.[ch. 571] Eventually, as Kurama is extracted from Naruto, the Tailed Beast tells Gaara how to save Naruto\\'s life by transferring Yin Kurama from Minato into Naruto. Kurama is later returned to its Jinchuriki\\'s body and becomes whole again as it reunites with its Yin counterpart. During the events of Boruto, Kurama convinces Naruto to use Baryon Mode in the fight against Isshiki, which results in Kurama ceasing to exist with Naruto rendered a normal human. Kishimoto was mainly inspired to create Kurama based on the character with the same name from the manga series YuYu Hakusho. The inclusion of the fox spirit was also inspired by Godzilla.\\nIn the Japanese anime, Kurama\\'s voice actor is Tesshō Genda, and in the English adaptation, he is voiced by Paul St. Peter. \\n=== Taka ===\\nTaka (鷹), originally named Hebi (蛇), is a group of shinobi formed by Sasuke originally to locate and kill Itachi Uchiha, but later allied with the Akatsuki to destroy Konohagakure.

The group gets split up after their attempt at terrorizing the Five Kage Summit, but they later reunite as part of the Allied Shinobi Forces. Following the war, they went back to Otogakure along with Orochimaru. \\n==== Suigetsu Hozuki ====\\nSuigetsu Hozuki (鬼灯水月, Hōzuki Suigetsu) is the first member to join. Originally from Kirigakure, his goal is to claim all of the swords wielded by the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist, and from there reform the organization in memory of his late brother Mangetsu, who was a member himself.[ch. 523] Although his dream was initially cut short by Orochimaru, after Sasuke freed him he managed to claim Zabuza\\'s sword, but lost it while battling the Kage. Suigetsu tends to have a sadistic personality, constantly fascinating about cutting things and consequently getting on Karin\\'s nerves, yet sees himself as normal in comparison to most other people. His clan has the ability to turn any part of their body into water, but must stay hydrated to do so.[ch. 347] Suigetsu is voiced by Takashi Kondo in Japanese and by Grant George in the English dub except in Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals, where he is voiced by Todd Haberkorn. \\n==== Karin ====\\nKarin (香燐) is the second member of Taka and a member of the Uzumaki Clan that Naruto belongs to. She was originally from Kusagakure and later another unnamed village, but after the latter was destroyed she was taken in by Orochimaru, eventually becoming a loyal servant to him. After briefly encountering Sasuke during the Chunin Exams, she became addicted to him and decided to join Taka to be at his side.[ch. 482] Karin was critically wounded by Sasuke during his battle against Danzo, and after he left her behind, Karin was arrested by Kakashi, in turn meeting Naruto for the first time[ch. 486]. She later met up with Sasuke to confront him, but instead immediately forgave him. Sometime after, she moved on from Sasuke due to wanting him to be happy and helped deliver Sasuke and Sakura\\'s daughter, Sarada. Karin is a Sensor Type, able to sense other\\'s chakra and feel a person\\'s aura that way, such as seeing Naruto\\'s chakra as \"bright and warm\". She also can heal people if they bite her, which causes them to absorb chakra, leaving permanent marks all over her body, but due to the risks involved she can only use it once per day. In Japanese, Karin is voiced by Kanako Tōjō up until Episode 485, when Toa Yukinari takes over. In English, she is voiced by Ali Hillis except in Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals, where she is voiced by Michelle Ruff. \\n==== Jugo ====\\nJugo (重吾, Jūgo) is the third member of Taka. His clan has the ability to use senjutsu, but due to the severe amount of natural energy they absorb they are prone to fits of extreme violence, with additional side effects being that they can revert to a childlike form if they use it the wrong way. Because of this, in childhood, Jugo was an outcast, eventually finding solace in Kimimaro whom he saw as an older sibling.[ch. 414] After meeting Sasuke, he tried to refuse being part of Taka and used his abilities, but Sasuke managed to calm him down. As Kimimaro was the only other person who could do this, Jugo decided to follow Sasuke in the belief that he was Kimimaro\\'s reincarnation.[ch. 414] Jugo is voiced by Shuhei Sakaguchi in Japanese and by Travis Willingham in the English dub except in Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals, where he is voiced by Patrick Seitz and is also voiced by Kyle Hebert in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. \\n=== Danzo Shimura === Danzo Shimura (志村 ダンゾウ, Shimura Danzō) is one of the oldest villagers in Konohagakure, and a moderately cantankerous war hawk who was Hiruzen\\'s rival whom he consequently opposed along with the other Hokage for placing world peace above their village\\'s best interests.[ch. 285] As Hiruzen obtained the Third Hokage title, Danzo uses the Foundation and his own personal Root black ops to secretly oversee their village\\'s security along with his personal goal to become a Hokage.[ch. 298] This led to Danzo being responsible for events that included Kabuto\\'s defection and orchestrating the Uchiha Massacre. The latter event result in him having the transplanted right eye of Shisui Uchiha, whom he killed, along with having Orochimaru using Shin\\'s genetic makeup to graft Danzo\\'s right arm with a large number of Sharingan eyes and Hashirama\\'s cells. Following Pain\\'s attack devastating Konohagakure, Danzo took advantage of Tsunade\\'s coma in convincing the Fire Country\\'s feudal lord to make him Acting Candidate Sixth Hokage (六代目火影候補, Rokudaime Hokage Kouho) and uses his position to decree Sasuke a wanted criminal before attaining the Five Kage summit to convince the formation of the Shinobi alliance with himself as its leader. But the plan fails as Danzo ends up being fatally wounded after being forced to fight Sasuke, using the last of his strength in an attempted sealing jutsu on his killer and Obito.[ch. 481] Though the jutsu failed, Danzō destroyed Shisui\\'s Sharingan to ensure Tobi would not obtain it. With Danzo\\'s death, the Foundation was disbanded in the aftermath of the Fourth Great Ninja War with its members allowed to live in peace while integrating back into society. In the Japanese anime he is voiced by Hiroshi Ito and in the English version he is voiced by William Frederick Knight except in Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals, where he is voiced by Richard Epcar. \\n=== Hanzo ===\\nHanzō (半蔵, Hanzō), also known as Hanzō of the Salamander (山椒魚の半蔵, Sanshōuo no Hanzō), was a legendary shinobi, and the leader of Amegakure during his lifetime.\\nHe defeated Konoha\\'s Sannin effortlessly, and practically murdered thousands of shinobi and samurai, including Yahiko, which partly caused Akatsuki\\'s violent reborn. \\n=== Rin Nohara ===\\nRin Nohara (のはら リン, Nohara Rin) is a girl member of Team Minato and the teammate of Kakashi Hatake and Obito Uchiha, appearing only in person during the Kakashi Gaiden act.[ch. 239] Rin acts as a medical ninja and had a crush on Kakashi, though she is unaware that she herself has the affection of Obito. When Team Minato is sent to sabotage Kannabi Bridge during the Third Great Ninja War, Rin is kidnapped by the Iwagakure ninja before the resulting rescue mission ends with Obito\\'s apparent death.[ch. 241, 243] Sometime afterward, Rin is captured by the Kirigakure ninja and made into Isobu\\'s Jinchuriki as part of a Trojan horse scheme to destroy Konoha. Rin realized the scheme while being rescued and jumped in the way of Kakashi\\'s Lightning Blade to save the village at the cost of her life, which is later revealed to have been orchestrated by Madara to break Obito\\'s spirit.[ch. 604, 630] Obito later learns upon his death that Rin\\'s spirit has always been waiting for him, and later guides him to the other side after he metaphysically helps Kakashi one last time in his team\\'s battle against Kaguya. In the Japanese anime, Rin\\'s voice actress is Haruhi Nanao, and her English voice actress is Stephanie Sheh. \\n=== Kushina Uzumaki ===\\nKushina Uzumaki (うずまき クシナ, Uzumaki Kushina) is the mother of the series\\' protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki and the wife of the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze.[ch. 382] She is a host of Kurama, immediately preceding Naruto.[ch. 499] While Naruto physically resembles his father, Minato, he inherits most of his personality from Kushina, who is brash, temperamental, likes ramen, and even has the \"Believe it!\" (だってばね, dattebane) verbal tic, which both her son and grandson inherit. Being a member of the Uzumaki Clan, Kushina possesses a special chakra that was distinguished even among her peers, causing her to be sent from her homeland to Konohagakure to be the host of Kurama, replacing Mito Uzumaki.[ch. 500] In Konohagakure, Kushina met with Minato who became Kushina\\'s love after he saved her from a kidnapper, leading to their marriage.[ch. 498] During her pregnancy, she had to be sent to a secretive place during labor to prevent Kurama\\'s seal being broken.[ch. 500] However, the place was subdued by Obito Uchiha, and he released Kurama who ran rampant on Konoha.[ch. 501] She and Minato both sacrifice their lives to seal Kurama to Naruto after the tailed beast is weakened from losing his yin-chakra, while also placing some of their chakra to their son as a fail-safe if he would break the seal.[ch. 503] In Part II, Kushina\\'s chakra appears during Naruto\\'s subconscious battle with Kurama, helping her son to seal the fox and to tell him the truth behind Kurama\\'s attack sixteen years ago.[ch. 497] Before disappearing, she thanks Naruto for forgiving her about the whole ordeal of the sealing of Kurama.[ch. 504] In the Japanese anime, Kushina is voiced by Emi Shinohara. She was voiced by Cindy Robinson in the English version before Laura Bailey took over the role since episode 246 and onwards. \\n=== Shisui Uchiha ===\\nShisui Uchiha (うちは シスイ, Uchiha Shisui), known as \"Shisui of the Body Flicker\" (瞬身のシスイ, Shunshin no Shisui), was one of the most talented of the Uchiha clan and Itachi\\'s best friend. Shisui possessed unique Mangekyo Sharingan that allow him to use the Kotoamatsukami ability, which allows him to manipulate others without their knowledge. Shisui intended to use Kotoamatsukami to stop the Uchiha\\'s coup when Danzo stole one of his eyes, giving his other eye to Itachi to protect the village to his stead as he commits suicide and later found on the river by Uchiha military policemen and assuming Shisui was murdered by Itachi. Danzo had the eye transplanted into him so he can manipulate others like Mifune to achieve his goals, later destroying it in his final moments to prevent Tobi from taking it. The eye given to Itachi, on the other hand, is placed in one of his crows and intended for it to be used by Naruto against Sasuke as a means to stop him from attacking the village. But a reanimated Itachi is forced to use it on himself to break free from Kabuto\\'s control, quickly destroying the eye to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. His voice actor in the Japanese anime is Hidenobu Kiuchi, while his voice actor in the English adaptation is Nicolas Roye. \\n== Reception ==\\nThe characters of Naruto have received both praise and criticism from publications dedicated to anime, manga, and other media. Active Anime lauded the characters for not being \"simple cardboard cut-out characters\" due to their \"fleshed out personalities\" and \"underlying dramatic motivations\", and praised the \"deeply moving emotional trials\" they undergo over the course of the series. Adam Cook of Anime Boredom agreed with this assessment, extolling the characters as \"well rounded\" and \"imaginative\", and celebrated how the characters allowed the series to successfully incorporate comedy, action, and drama together in a believable manner. A review from Derrick Tucker, also of THEM Anime Reviews offered a positive view, commenting that Naruto Uzumaki combined the finer values of his shōnen predecessors, but lamented how the characters\\' personalities tended to fall between Naruto\\'s \"charisma and coolness\" and Sasuke\\'s \"blandness\", making it difficult to think about the characters on \"any deep or meaningful level\". Justin Rich of the entertainment website Mania asserted that the series lacked the \"tremendous depth in it\\'s [sic] characters\" or \"the most flushed out backgrounds\" seen in other shōnen series, and believed the primary strength of the series was the fighting.\\nThe visual appearances of the characters in the anime and manga have also received notice from reviewers. Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network praised the characters\\' \"distinctive clothing, hair, faces and personalities\" that made them easily identifiable, as well as Kishimoto\\'s \"clear eye for geography, movement and the human form\" and \"impeccable visual timing\". Tucker, on the other hand, described Kishimoto as \"an average artist at best\" and derided the poor transition of his artistic style into animation. Despite this, he admitted that when the animators were at their best, they produced \"artistic renderings that leave little to be desired on the part of fans of the manga\", but ultimately concluded the animation was \"a mixed bag\". \\n== Footnotes == \\n== References ==\\nKishimoto, Masashi (2007).

       " 'Jiraiya': 'Jiraiya (自来也 or 児雷也, literally \"Young Thunder\"), originally known as Ogata Shuma Hiroyuki (尾形周馬寛行), is the toad-riding protagonist of the Japanese folk tale Katakiuchi Kidan Jiraiya Monogatari (報仇奇談自来也説話, The Tale of the Gallant Jiraiya). The tale was originally a Yomihon that was published in 1806–1807, and was adapted into a serialized novel that was written by different authors and published in 43 installments from 1839 to 1868; one of its illustrators was woodblock artist Kunisada. Kawatake Mokuami then wrote a kabuki drama based on the first ten parts of the novel, which premiered in Edo in 1852, starring Ichikawa Danjūrō VIII in the leading role. Since then the story has been adapted into, several films, video games, and manga and has also influenced various other works. \\n== Classic tale – Katakiuchi Kidan Jiraiya Monogatari ==\\nKatakiuchi Kidan Jiraiya Monogatari (報仇奇談自来也説話)  is considered the first novel or Yomihon to be adapted into a kabuki play, the novel was written by Kanwatei Onitake (感和亭鬼武) and was published between 1806 and 1807. The story was later adapted many more times with variations in the story. \\n=== Part 1: (books 1–5) ===\\nThe tale of Jiraiya starts with a poor, masterless samurai named Isami Gentaro, who\\'s wrongfully jailed because he could not afford the rent for his farm. His family manages to get the money to pay his bail so Isami\\'s father, Kirakusai, travels alongside his grandson, Tomokichi, to pay Isami\\'s bail. However, on the way to free Isami, Kirakusai is attacked and killed by Master Rokuyaon Gun who kidnaps the two-year-old Tomokichi and abandons him in a valley. During this time, a masterless samurai of the Miyoshi House, Ogata Shuma Hiroyuki, better known as \"Jiraiya\", happens upon the young Tomokichi and decides to raise him as his son.\\nGentaro is later released with the help of other villagers and becomes a vassal of Shiizu Kunihisa after proving his courage as a samurai at the same time as Master Gun. Gentaro and Master Gun then begin working together to capture Jiraiya as he is a wanted criminal. Fortunately, though caught, Jiraiya manages to scheme his way out of jail. Gentaro eventually meets his wife, Soe (who now goes by \"Seino\") and they discuss the former\\'s hatred for whoever killed his father and son, both unaware the latter is alive. Master Gun eavesdrops on this conversation and decides to steal their Amulet of Protection, also known as the \"Seitensō\" (西天草), and proceeds to kill both Gentaro and Soe. Tomokichi—whilst engaged in a duel with Master Gun for Midori, the stepdaughter of Gentaro—learns that it was he who murdered his family. While this allows Tomokichi a chance to exact his revenge, he is unable to take it as Master Gun uses the Amulet of Protection to escape.\\nMaster Gun is chased to Mt. Miyoko by Tomokichi and, upon reaching the mountain, is accosted by the spirits of the dead until he arrives to a grotto where the Immortal Toad Ascetic lives. They converse and the immortal sees all of Master Guns\\' sins and even tells him that, since there are dead souls haunting him, he must be a murderer and that he\\'ll die from his sins. Terrified, Master Gun begs the immortal to save him, to which he agrees but saying he will only help him once. The immortal then uses his magic arts to send Master Gun down the mountain before warning him if he tells anyone of this encounter he will die. However, later that night, after getting drunk with one of Jiraiya\\'s followers, Master Gun tells him of the events at Mt. Miyoko. The morning after Master Gun leaves, Jiraiya goes to Mt. Miyoko to visit the Immortal. The Toad Ascetic then appears in front of Jiraiya and tells him that, even though he is a bandit who committed innumerable sins, he\\'ll teach him one magic art as he admires Jiraiya\\'s loyalty. While Master Gun and Jiraiya are visiting the immortal, Tomokichi sets out to find them and, upon finally locating Jiraiya, recounts to his stepfather of what has happened to his family. Jiraiya vows to assist Tomokichi in his revenge and will be there to help when he is needed, sending his troops to steal the Seitenso from Master Gun so as to lure him out in order to kill him.\\nAfter luring Master Gun to a place called Kagamigaura, Tomokichi and Master Gun then engage in battle. While Tomokichi almost fails, he is able to turn the tide thanks to Jiraiya\\'s encouragement, announces he\\'ll avenge his grandfather and parents, and finally cuts off Master Guns\\' head, ending part one and the first revenge story. \\n=== Part 2: (books 5–10) ===\\nThe second part opens up with the immortal on Mt. Miyoko appearing to Jiraiya in his dreams asking for his assistance in return for teaching him more magic arts. Jiraiya sets off towards the mountain to save his master and, when he arrives, sees a monstrous snake fighting his master, who\\'s taken on the form of a giant toad. Jiraiya manages to kill the snake and is rewarded by the immortal with more magic arts, which he then uses to rob a wealthy man right after learning them. Since Jiraiya is wanted by the government, he became a pirate and started plundering commercial ships, until one night at sea the ghost of his former lord, Miyoshi Nagashige asks him to take revenge on the Ishido family, more specifically Ishido Haruchika. Jiraiya agrees and he soon after saves a vassal of Ishido named Agawa Uneo, and his companion Nagisa, the younger sister of another vassal named Madeno Hamanosuke, to which he tosses Agawa Uneo into the sea and takes Nagisa hostage. Agawa Uneo is then saved by a former member of his group and begins to pursue Jiraiya immediately after recovering. During this time, Madeno Hamanosuke goes to Mt. Kinki to pray to Benzaiten, a god related to snakes, for the safety of his lord. He is answered by a goddess who appears before him and gives him the Stone Conch, otherwise known as the \"Ishihara\" (石螺), which holds the power to negate magic arts and repel evil.\\nMeanwhile, Tomokichi has become a vassal of Shiizu Kunihisa after taking revenge on Master Gun and is ordered to take back the Amulet of Protection from Jiraiya, to which he sets off in search of his adoptive father. After finding Jiraiya, Tomokichi asks him to return the Amulet of Protection to which the former agrees, but only after the next six months as he needs it to complete his revenge. In order to keep this meeting a secret, Jiraiya summons a powerful tsunami to kill all of Tomokichi\\'s troops despite the latter\\'s pleads for mercy to his men. After all is said and done, Jiraiya invites Tomokichi to go with him on his revenge quest so that he would not be punished.\\nJiraiya then begins his plan, first by robbing betrothal gifts for Ishido Haruchika\\'s daughter, Tamahitohime, which leads to the death of Nagisa. After sneaking into the Nitsuki House, Jiraiya summons a tsunami to kill all of the servants in order for his troops to pose as them and sneak into the Ishido residence. Jiraiya then finds a mountain hermit who was going to treat one of Ishido Haruchika\\'s sick daughters and kills him, he then pretends to be the mountain hermit in order to sneak into the Ishido House. After sneaking into Ishido Haruchikas\\'s room, Jiraiya then cuts off his head.\\nAfterwards, Jiraiya calls on Tomokichi to return the Amulet of Protection as promised. However, Madeno Hamanosuke shows up and announces the head of the man Jiraiya cut off actually belonged to Agawa Uneo and all of his troops were captured because a member of the Jiraiya\\'s group, Asazuma was a vassal of Ishido and warned the Ishido house of his plan. Jiraiya tries to use his magic arts to defeat Madeno Hamanosuke, however, Madeno uses the Stone Conch that was given to him by Benzaiten to negate Jiraiya\\'s magic arts. Jiraiya finally realizes that his death is at hand as he lived a sinful life and this is his justice so, before anyone can kill him, he commits suicide and turns to stone. \\n=== Characters ===\\nIsami Gentaro – Tomokichis\\'s father who is imprisoned at the beginning of the story, and later becomes a vassal of Shiizu Kunihisa.

The story starts with Jiraiya\\'s father, who was a castle lord, but was killed during one of many civil wars. After he is killed, young Jiraiya is hidden by a retainer and is able to escape, but they are attacked by a band of robbers and the retainer is killed after resisting. Jiraiya goes to a place called Echigo where he spent the rest of his childhood. Jiraiya now led a wandering life in several provinces but wished to restore his family name. His swordsmanship talent and exceptional bravery allowed Jiraiya to soon become a chief of his own band of robbers, where he would sneak in disguise to places he robbed in order to learn where the treasure was stored. He would then come back and steal said treasure later.\\nOne day, Jiraiya heard of an old man who lived in Shinano and so he started off to rob him. The land was a place full of mountains and was full of snow in the winter. During the journey, he was beset by a great snowstorm and he took refuge in a small house that he happened upon, inside was a beautiful woman who treated him with great kindness. This did not change Jiraiya\\'s nature as a robber though and after midnight he went to kill her with his sword while she was reading. However, in a flash, her body changed to a very old man who grabbed the heavy steel blade and easily broke it into pieces. He then announces his name as Senso Dojin, and that he is a giant frog that has lived on the mountain for hundreds of years. He pardons Jiraiya after telling him he could kill him easily and then teaches him magic arts. Jiraiya stayed with Senso Dojin for several weeks learning the magic arts of the mountain sprites in order to control the weather as well as to control frogs and change their shape and size at will. After Senso teaches him he forbids him from robbing or injuring the poor and helpless and to instead take from those who use and acquire money dishonestly and to help the needy and suffering. He then turns into a giant frog and hops away.\\nAfter this Jiraiya sets out on his journey to help the poor and needy by helping a poor farmer whose crops failed and he could not pay his rent or loan on time. As well whenever a miser was robbed they would say that the young thunder had struck, as Jiraiya was very popular with the poor people of the time. During this time when Jiraiya was helping the poor and needy, a young maiden named Tsunade also lived in the same province of Kiushiu. She was a model daughter and was always obedient and kind. One day during her trip into the mountains for firewood she met a very old man who approached her and told her he had lived in the mountains for hundreds of years and that his body was really that of a snail. He then offers to teach Tsunade the powers of magic he possesses. She gladly accepted and began training daily with the old man. Once she had mastered the magic, she was advised to use her powers to defend the poor and destroy wicked robbers, and to join her powers with Jiraiya in the form of marriage. The old man then turns into a snail and crawls away. Tsunade then remarks that she and Jiraiya with the combination of slug magic and frog magic would be able to destroy a robber named Orochimaru, who was the son of a serpent. Tsunade and Jiraiya eventually met and were married soon after.\\nSoon after Jiraiya and Tsunade were married war broke out in Japan between the Tsukikage and the Inukage. In the war, the Tsukikage sought out the help of Jiraiya and Tsunade who agreed to help them with the war, while the other clan the Inukage sought the help of Orochimaru otherwise known as Dragon-coil. Orochimaru was known as a very wicked robber whose father was a man and mother was a serpent that lived at the bottom of lake Takura, he was skilled in the magic of the serpent and would spew venom on the strongest of warriors to destroy them.\\nDuring a respite between the conflicts, Jiraiya and Tsunade were resting in a monastery. In the monastery, there was also a princess named Tagoto that had fled from Orochimaru as he wanted her to be his bride. She hated Orochimaru and did not want to marry him, however, when Orochimaru upon hearing that Tagoto and Jiraiya were in the same monastery, immediately made his way to the monastery. He then kidnapped the princess Tagoto and poured poisonous venom onto the sleeping Jiraiya and Tsunade. After they are poisoned one of Jiraiya\\'s pages, Rikimatsu, volunteers to go to India to retrieve the only antidote to cure Jiraiya and Tsunade. Rikimatsu then uses the magic he learned from the Tengus of the mountains he flies to India and back in one day and one night to deliver the antidote. After Jiraiya and his wife recovered the war broke out again, and in a great battle Orochimaru was killed and Tagoto was rescued. Jiraiya was rewarded by being made a daimyo of Idzu.\\nAt this point, Jiraiya had grown tired of war and the hardships that an active life brought, and he was glad to settle down to a peaceful life in Idzu. He spent the remainder of his day in peace and tranquility among his children and his grandchildren. \\n=== Characters ===\\nOgata - Jiraiyas\\'s late father was a castle lord in Kiushiu and was slain during a civil war.\\nJiraiya – otherwise known as “young thunder”, is the protagonist of the story, his father was a castle laird in Kisushiu but is killed when he is young.

      "A kunai (苦無, kunai) is a Japanese tool thought to be originally derived from the masonry trowel. The two widely recognized kinds are the short kunai (小苦無 shō-kunai) and the big kunai (大苦無 dai-kunai). Although a basic tool, the kunai, in the hands of a martial arts expert, could be used as a multi-functional weapon. The kunai is commonly associated with the ninja, who in folklore use them to climb walls. \n",
      "== Design == A Kunai normally had a leaf-shaped wrought blade in lengths ranging from 20 and 30 cm (7.9 and 11.8 in) and a handle with a ring on the pommel for attaching a rope. The attached rope allowed the kunai's handle to be wrapped to function as a grip, or to be strapped to a stick as a makeshift spear; to be tied to the body for concealment; to be used as an anchor or piton, and sometimes to be used as the Chinese rope dart. Contrary to popular belief, kunai were not designed to be used primarily as throwing weapons. Instead, kunai were primarily tools and, when used as weapons, were stabbing and thrusting implements.\n",
      "Varieties of kunai include short, long, narrow-bladed, saw-toothed, and wide-bladed. In some cases, the kunai and the Nishikori, a wide-bladed saw with a dagger-type handle, are difficult to distinguish. \n",
      "== Uses == The kunai was originally used by peasants as a multi-purpose gardening tool and by workers of stone and masonry. The blade is made of soft iron and is left unsharpened because the edges are used to smash relatively soft materials such as plaster and wood, for digging holes, and for prying. Normally, only the tip is sharpened. \n",
      "=== Weapon ===\n",
      "Many ninja weapons were adapted from farming tools, not unlike those used by Shaolin monks in China. Since kunai were cheaply produced farming tools of proper size and weight and could be easily sharpened, they were readily available to be converted into simple weapons.  As a weapon, the kunai is larger and heavier than a shuriken and with the grip could also be used in hand-to-hand combat more readily than a shuriken. \n",
      "As with ninjutsu, the exaggeration persistent in ninja myths played a large role in creating the popular culture image of kunai. In fictional depictions of ninjas, the kunai is commonly portrayed as a steel knife that is used for stabbing or particularly throwing, sometimes confused with the shuriken. \n",
      "=== Masonry ===\n",
      "The kunai was used in masonry to shape stonework. \n",

      "A ninja (Japanese: 忍者, lit. 'one who is invisible'; [ɲiꜜɲdʑa]) or shinobi (Japanese: 忍び, lit. 'one who sneaks'; [ɕinobi]) was a covert agent, mercenary, or guerrilla warfare expert in feudal Japan. The functions of a ninja included siege and infiltration, ambush, reconnaissance, espionage, deception, and later bodyguarding and their fighting skills in martial arts, including ninjutsu. Their covert methods of waging irregular warfare were deemed dishonorable and beneath the honor of the samurai. Though shinobi proper, as specially trained warriors, spies, and mercenaries, appeared in the 15th century during the Sengoku period, antecedents may have existed as early as the 12th century.\n",
      "In the unrest of the Sengoku period, jizamurai families, that is, elite peasant-warriors, in Iga Province and the adjacent Kōka District formed ikki – \"revolts\" or \"leagues\" – as a means of self-defense. They became known for their military activities in the nearby regions and sold their services as mercenaries and spies. It is from these areas that much of the knowledge regarding the ninja is drawn. Following the unification of Japan under the Tokugawa shogunate in the 17th century, the ninja faded into obscurity. A number of shinobi manuals, often based on Chinese military philosophy, were written in the 17th and 18th centuries, most notably the Bansenshūkai (1676).\n",
      "By the time of the Meiji Restoration (1868), shinobi had become a topic of popular imagination and mystery in Japan. Ninja figured prominently in legend and folklore, where they were associated with legendary abilities such as invisibility, walking on water, and control over natural elements. Much of their perception in popular culture is based on such legends and folklore, as opposed to the covert actors of the Sengoku period. \n",
      "== Etymology == Ninja is the on'yomi (Early Middle Chinese–influenced) reading of the two kanji \"忍者\". In the native kun'yomi reading, it is pronounced shinobi, a shortened form of shinobi-no-mono (忍びの者).\n",
      "The word shinobi appears in the written record as far back as the late 8th century in poems in the Man'yōshū. The underlying connotation of shinobi (忍) means \"to steal away; to hide\" and—by extension—\"to forbear\", hence its association with stealth and invisibility. Mono (者) means \"a person\".\n",
      "Historically, the word ninja was not in common use, and a variety of regional colloquialisms evolved to describe what would later be dubbed ninja. Along with shinobi, these include monomi (\"one who sees\"), nokizaru (\"macaque on the roof\"), rappa (\"ruffian\"), kusa (\"grass\") and Iga-mono (\"one from Iga\"). In historical documents, shinobi is almost always used.\n",
      "Kunoichi (くノ一) is, originally, an argot which means \"woman\";: p168  it supposedly comes from the characters くノ一 (respectively hiragana ku, katakana no and kanji ichi), which make up the three strokes that form the kanji for \"woman\" (女).: p168  In fiction written in the modern era kunoichi means \"female ninja\".: p167 \n",
      "In the Western world, the word ninja became more prevalent than shinobi in the post–World War II culture, possibly because it was more comfortable for Western speakers. In English, the plural of ninja can be either unchanged as ninja, reflecting the Japanese language's lack of grammatical number, or the regular English plural ninjas. \n",
      "== History == Despite many popular folktales, historical accounts of the ninja are scarce. Historian Stephen Turnbull asserts that the ninja were mostly recruited from the lower class, and therefore little literary interest was taken in them. The social origin of the ninja is seen as the reason they agree to operate in secret, trading their service for money without honor and glory. The scarcity of historical accounts is also demonstrated in war epics such as The Tale of Hōgen (Hōgen Monogatari) and The Tale of the Heike (Heike Monogatari), which focus mainly on the aristocratic samurai, whose deeds were apparently more appealing to the audience.\n",
      "Historian Kiyoshi Watatani states that the ninja were trained to be particularly secretive about their actions and existence: So-called ninjutsu techniques, in short are the skills of shinobi-no-jutsu and shinobijutsu, which have the aims of ensuring that one's opponent does not know of one's existence, and for which there was special training.\n",
      "However, some ninjutsu books described specifically what tactics ninja should use to fight, and the scenarios a ninja might find themselves can be deduced from those tactics. For example, in the manuscript of volume 2 of Kanrin Seiyō (間林清陽) which is the original book of Bansenshūkai (万川集海), there are 48 points of ninja's fighting techniques, such as how to make makibishi from bamboo, how to make footwear that makes no sound, fighting techniques when surrounded by many enemies, precautions when using swords at night, how to listen to small sounds, kuji-kiri that prevents guard dogs from barking, and so on. \n",
      "=== Predecessors === The title ninja has sometimes been attributed retrospectively to the semi-legendary 2nd-century prince Yamato Takeru. In the Kojiki, the young Yamato Takeru disguised himself as a charming maiden and assassinated two chiefs of the Kumaso people. However, these records take place at a very early stage of Japanese history, and they are unlikely to be connected to the shinobi of later accounts. The first recorded use of espionage was under the employment of Prince Shōtoku in the 6th century. Such tactics were considered unsavory even in early times, when, according to the 10th-century Shōmonki, the boy spy Hasetsukabe no Koharumaru was killed for spying against the insurgent Taira no Masakado. Later, the 14th-century war chronicle Taiheiki contained many references to shinobi and credited the destruction of a castle by fire to an unnamed but \"highly skilled shinobi\". \n",
      "=== Early history ===\n",
      "It was not until the 15th century that spies were specially trained for their purpose. It was around this time that the word shinobi appeared to define and clearly identify ninja as a secretive group of agents. Evidence for this can be seen in historical documents, which began to refer to stealthy soldiers as shinobi during the Sengoku period. Later manuals regarding espionage are often grounded in Chinese military strategy, quoting works such as The Art of War by Sun Tzu.\n",
      "The ninja emerged as mercenaries in the 15th century, where they were recruited as spies, raiders, arsonists and even terrorists. Amongst the samurai, a sense of ritual and decorum was observed, where one was expected to fight or duel openly. Combined with the unrest of the Sengoku period, these factors created a demand for men willing to commit deeds considered disreputable for conventional warriors. By the Sengoku period, the shinobi had several roles, including spy (kanchō), scout (teisatsu), surprise attacker (kishu), and agitator (konran). The ninja families were organized into larger guilds, each with their own territories. A system of rank existed. A jōnin (\"upper person\") was the highest rank, representing the group and hiring out mercenaries. This is followed by the chūnin (\"middle person\"), assistants to the jōnin. At the bottom was the genin (\"lower person\"), field agents drawn from the lower class and assigned to carry out actual missions. \n",
      "=== Iga and Kōga clans === The Iga and Kōga \"clans\" were jizamurai families living in the province of Iga (modern Mie Prefecture) and the adjacent region of Kōka (later written as Kōga), named after a village in what is now Shiga Prefecture. From these regions, villages devoted to the training of ninja first appeared. The remoteness and inaccessibility of the surrounding mountains in Iga may have had a role in the ninja's secretive development. Historical documents regarding the ninja's origins in these mountainous regions are considered generally correct. The chronicle Go Kagami Furoku writes, of the two clans' origins: There was a retainer of the family of Kawai Aki-no-kami of Iga, of pre-eminent skill in shinobi, and consequently for generations the name of people from Iga became established. Another tradition grew in Kōga.\n",
      "Likewise, a supplement to the Nochi Kagami, a record of the Ashikaga shogunate, confirms the same Iga origin: Inside the camp at Magari of the shōgun [Ashikaga] Yoshihisa there were shinobi whose names were famous throughout the land. When Yoshihisa attacked Rokkaku Takayori, the family of Kawai Aki-no-kami of Iga, who served him at Magari, earned considerable merit as shinobi in front of the great army of the shōgun. Since then successive generations of Iga men have been admired. This is the origin of the fame of the men of Iga.\n",
      "A distinction is to be made between the ninja from these areas, and commoners or samurai hired as spies or mercenaries. Unlike their counterparts, the Iga and Kōga clans were professionals, specifically trained for their roles. These professional ninja were actively hired by daimyōs between 1485 and 1581. Specifically, the Iga professionals were sought after for their skill at siege warfare, or \"shirotori\", which included night attacks and ambush. By the 1460s, the leading families in the regions had established de facto independence from their shugo. The Kōka ikki persisted until 1574, when it was forced to become a vassal of Oda Nobunaga. The Iga ikki continued until 1581, when Nobunaga invaded Iga Province and wiped out the organized clans. Survivors were forced to flee, some to the mountains of Kii, but others arrived before Tokugawa Ieyasu, where they were well treated. Some former Iga clan members, including Hattori Hanzō, would later serve as Tokugawa's bodyguards. Prior to the conquest of Kōka in 1574, the two confederacies worked in alliance together from at least 1487.\n",
      "Following the Battle of Okehazama in 1560, Tokugawa employed a group of eighty Kōga ninja, led by Tomo Sukesada. They were tasked to raid an outpost of the Imagawa clan. The account of this assault is given in the Mikawa Go Fudoki, where it was written that Kōga ninja infiltrated the castle, set fire to its towers, and killed the castellan along with two hundred of the garrison. The Kōga ninja are said to have played a role in the later Battle of Sekigahara (1600), where several hundred Kōga assisted soldiers under Torii Mototada in the defence of Fushimi Castle. After Tokugawa's victory at Sekigahara, the Iga acted as guards for the inner compounds of Edo Castle, while the Kōga acted as a police force and assisted in guarding the outer gate. In 1614, the initial \"winter campaign\" at the Siege of Osaka saw the ninja in use once again. Miura Yoemon, a ninja in Tokugawa's service, recruited shinobi from the Iga region, and sent 10 ninja into Osaka Castle in an effort to foster antagonism between enemy commanders. During the later \"summer campaign\", these hired ninja fought alongside regular troops at the Battle of Tennōji. \n",
      "=== Shimabara rebellion === A final but detailed record of ninja employed in open warfare occurred during the Shimabara Rebellion (1637–1638). The Kōga ninja were recruited by shōgun Tokugawa Iemitsu against Christian rebels led by Amakusa Shirō, who made a final stand at Hara Castle, in Hizen Province. A diary kept by a member of the Matsudaira clan, the Amakusa Gunki, relates: \"Men from Kōga in Ōmi Province who concealed their appearance would steal up to the castle every night and go inside as they pleased.\"\n",
      "The Ukai diary, written by a descendant of Ukai Kanemon, has several entries describing the reconnaissance actions taken by the Kōga. They [the Kōga] were ordered to reconnoitre the plan of construction of Hara Castle, and surveyed the distance from the defensive moat to the ni-no-maru (second bailey), the depth of the moat, the conditions of roads, the height of the wall, and the shape of the loopholes. Suspecting that the castle's supplies might be running low, the siege commander Matsudaira Nobutsuna ordered a raid on the castle's provisions. Here, the Kōga captured bags of enemy provisions, and infiltrated the castle by night, obtaining secret passwords. Days later, Nobutsuna ordered an intelligence gathering mission to determine the castle's supplies. Several Kōga ninja—some apparently descended from those involved in the 1562 assault on an Imagawa clan castle—volunteered despite being warned that chances of survival were slim. A volley of shots was fired into the sky, causing the defenders to extinguish the castle lights in preparation. Under the cloak of darkness, ninja disguised as defenders infiltrated the castle, capturing a banner of the Christian cross. The Ukai diary writes, We dispersed spies who were prepared to die inside Hara castle. ... those who went on the reconnaissance in force captured an enemy flag; both Arakawa Shichirobei and Mochizuki Yo'emon met extreme resistance and suffered from their serious wounds for 40 days.\n",
      "As the siege went on, the extreme shortage of food later reduced the defenders to eating moss and grass. This desperation would mount to futile charges by the rebels, where they were eventually defeated by the shogunate army. The Kōga would later take part in conquering the castle: More and more general raids were begun, the Kōga ninja band under the direct control of Matsudaira Nobutsuna captured the ni-no-maru and the san-no-maru (outer bailey) ...\n",
      "With the fall of Hara Castle, the Shimabara Rebellion came to an end, and Christianity in Japan was forced underground. These written accounts are the last mention of ninja in war. \n",
      "=== Edo period ===\n",
      "After the Shimabara Rebellion, there were almost no major wars or battles until the bakumatsu era. To earn a living, ninja had to be employed by the governments of their Han (domain), or change their profession. Many lords still hired ninja, not for battle but as bodyguards or spies. Their duties included spying on other domains, guarding the daimyō, and fire patrol. A few domains like Tsu, Hirosaki and Saga continued to employ their own ninja into the bakumatsu era, although their precise numbers are unknown.\n",
      "Many former ninja were employed as security guards by the Tokugawa shogunate, though the role of espionage was transferred to newly created organizations like the onmitsu and the oniwaban. Others used their ninjutsu knowledge to become doctors, medicine sellers, merchants, martial artists, and fireworks manufacturers. Some unemployed ninja were reduced to banditry, such as Fūma Kotarō and Ishikawa Goemon. \n",
      "==== Oniwaban ==== In the early 18th century, shogun Tokugawa Yoshimune founded the oniwaban (\"garden keepers\"), an intelligence agency and secret service. Members of the oniwaban were agents involved in collecting information on daimyō and government officials. The secretive nature of the oniwaban—along with the earlier tradition of using Iga and Kōga clan members as palace guards—have led some sources to define the oniwabanshū as \"ninja\". This portrayal is also common in later novels and jidaigeki. However, there is no written link between the earlier shinobi and the later oniwaban. \n",
      "==== Ninja stereotypes in theatre ====\n",
      "Many ubiquitous stereotypes about ninja were developed within Edo theatre. These include their black clothing, which was supposed to imitate the outfits worn by kuroko, stagehands meant to be ignored by the audience; and their use of shuriken, which was meant to contrast with the use of swords by onstage samurai. In kabuki theatre, ninja were \"dishonorable and often sorcerous counterparts\" to samurai, and possessed \"almost, if not outright, magical means of camouflage.\" \n",
      "=== Contemporary === Between 1960 and 2010 artifacts dating to the Siege of Odawara (1590) were uncovered which experts say are ninja weapons. Ninja were spies and saboteurs and likely participated in the siege. The Hojo clan failed to save the castle from Toyotomi Hideyoshi forces. The uncovered flat throwing stones are likely predecessors of the shuriken. The clay caltrops preceded makibishi caltrops. Archeologist Iwata Akihiro of Saitama Prefectural Museum of History and Folklore said the flat throwing stones \"were used to stop the movement of the enemy who was going to attack [a soldier] at any moment, and while the enemy freezed the soldier escaped,\". The clay caltrops could \"stop the movement of the enemy who invaded the castle,\" These weapons were hastily constructed yet effective and used by a \"battle group which can move into action as ninjas\".\n",
      "In 2012, Jinichi Kawakami, the last authentic heir of ninjutsu, decided against passing on his teaching to any student, stating that the art of ninjutsu has no place in modern times. Instead, Kawakami serves as the honorary director of the Iga-ryu Ninja Museum and researches ninjutsu as a specially appointed professor at Mie University.\n",
      "Mie University founded the world's first research centre devoted to the ninja in 2017. A graduate master course opened in 2018. It is located in Iga (now Mie Prefecture). There are approximately 3 student enrollments per year. Students must pass an admission test about Japanese history and be able to read historical ninja documents. Scientific researchers and scholars of different disciplines study ancient documents and how it can be used in the modern world.\n",
      "In 2020, the 45-year-old Genichi Mitsuhashi was the first student to graduate from the master course of ninja studies at Mie University. For 2 years he studied historical records and the traditions of the martial art. Similar to the original ninja, by day he was a farmer and grew vegetables while he did ninja studies and trained martial arts in the afternoon.\n",
      "On June 19, 2022, Kōka city in Shiga Prefecture announced that a written copy of \"Kanrinseiyo\", which is the original source of a famous book on the art of ninja called \"Bansenshukai\" (1676) from the Edo period was discovered in a warehouse of Kazuraki Shrine. The handwritten reproduction was produced in 1748. The book describes 48 types of ninjutsu. It has information about specific methods such as attaching layers of cotton to the bottom of straw sandals to prevent noise when sneaking around, attacking to the right when surrounded by a large number of enemies, throwing charred owl and turtle powder when trying to hide, and casting spells. It also clarified methods and how to manufacture and use ninjutsu tools, such as cane swords and \"makibishi\" (Japanese caltrop). \n",
      "== Roles ==\n",
      "The ninja were stealth soldiers and mercenaries hired mostly by daimyōs. Their primary roles were those of espionage and sabotage, although assassinations were also attributed to ninja. Although they were considered the anti-samurai and were disdained by those belonging to the samurai class, they were necessary for warfare and were even employed by the samurai themselves to carry out operations that were forbidden by bushidō. \n",
      "In his Buke Myōmokushō, military historian Hanawa Hokinoichi writes of the ninja: They travelled in disguise to other territories to judge the situation of the enemy, they would inveigle their way into the midst of the enemy to discover gaps, and enter enemy castles to set them on fire, and carried out assassinations, arriving in secret. \n",
      "=== Espionage ===\n",
      "Espionage was the chief role of the ninja. With the aid of disguises, the ninja gathered information on enemy terrain and building specifications, as well as obtaining passwords and communiques. The aforementioned supplement to the Nochi Kagami briefly describes the ninja's role in espionage: Concerning ninja, they were said to be from Iga and Kōga, and went freely into enemy castles in secret. They observed hidden things, and were taken as being friends.\n",
      "Later in history, the Kōga ninja would become regarded as agents of the Tokugawa bakufu, at a time when the bakufu used the ninja in an intelligence network to monitor regional daimyōs as well as the Imperial court. \n",
      "=== Sabotage ===\n",
      "Arson was the primary form of sabotage practiced by the ninja, who targeted castles and camps.\n",
      "The Tamon-in Nikki (16th century)—a diary written by abbot Eishun of Kōfuku-ji temple—describes an arson attack on a castle by men of the Iga clans. This morning, the sixth day of the 11th month of Tenbun 10 [1541], the Iga-shu entered Kasagi castle in secret and set fire to a few of the priests' quarters. They also set fire to outbuildings in various places inside the San-no-maru. They captured the ichi-no-maru (inner bailey) and the ni-no-maru (second bailey).\n",
      "In 1558, Rokkaku Yoshikata employed a team of ninja to set fire to Sawayama Castle. A chūnin captain led a force of 48 ninja into the castle by means of deception. In a technique dubbed bakemono-jutsu (\"ghost technique\"), his men stole a lantern bearing the enemy's family crest (mon), and proceeded to make replicas with the same mon. By wielding these lanterns, they were allowed to enter the castle without a fight. Once inside, the ninja set fire to the castle, and Yoshitaka's army would later emerge victorious. The mercenary nature of the shinobi is demonstrated in another arson attack soon after the burning of Sawayama Castle. In 1561, commanders acting under Kizawa Nagamasa hired three Iga ninja of genin rank to assist the conquest of a fortress in Maibara. Rokkaku Yoshitaka, the same man who had hired Iga ninja just years earlier, was the fortress holder—and target of attack. The Asai Sandaiki writes of their plans: \"We employed shinobi-no-mono of Iga... They were contracted to set fire to the castle\". However, the mercenary shinobi were unwilling to take commands. When the fire attack did not begin as scheduled, the Iga men told the commanders, who were not from the region, that they could not possibly understand the tactics of the shinobi. They then threatened to abandon the operation if they were not allowed to act on their own strategy. The fire was eventually set, allowing Nagamasa's army to capture the fortress in a chaotic rush. \n",
      "=== Assassination === The best-known cases of assassination attempts involve famous historical figures. Deaths of famous persons have sometimes been attributed to assassination by ninja, but the secretive natures of these scenarios have made them difficult to prove. Assassins were often identified as ninja later on, but there is no evidence to prove whether some were specially trained for the task or simply a hired thug.\n",
      "The warlord Oda Nobunaga's notorious reputation led to several attempts on his life. In 1571, a Kōga ninja and sharpshooter by the name of Sugitani Zenjubō was hired to assassinate Nobunaga. Using two arquebuses, he fired two consecutive shots at Nobunaga, but was unable to inflict mortal injury through Nobunaga's armor. Sugitani managed to escape, but was caught four years later and put to death by torture. In 1573, Manabe Rokurō, a vassal of daimyō Hatano Hideharu, attempted to infiltrate Azuchi Castle and assassinate the sleeping Nobunaga. However, this also ended in failure, and Manabe was forced to commit suicide, after which his body was openly displayed in public. According to a document, the Iranki, when Nobunaga was inspecting Iga province—which his army had devastated—a group of three ninja shot at him with large-caliber firearms. The shots flew wide of Nobunaga, however, and instead killed seven of his surrounding companions.\n",
      "The ninja Hachisuka Tenzō was sent by Nobunaga to assassinate the powerful daimyō Takeda Shingen, but ultimately failed in his attempts. Hiding in the shadow of a tree, he avoided being seen under the moonlight, and later concealed himself in a hole he had prepared beforehand, thus escaping capture.\n",
      "An assassination attempt on Toyotomi Hideyoshi was also thwarted. A ninja named Kirigakure Saizō (possibly Kirigakure Shikaemon) thrust a spear through the floorboards to kill Hideyoshi, but was unsuccessful. He was \"smoked out\" of his hiding place by another ninja working for Hideyoshi, who apparently used a sort of primitive \"flamethrower\". Unfortunately, the veracity of this account has been clouded by later fictional publications depicting Saizō as one of the legendary Sanada Ten Braves.\n",
      "Uesugi Kenshin, the famous daimyō of Echigo Province, was rumored to have been killed by a ninja. The legend credits his death to an assassin who is said to have hidden in Kenshin's lavatory, and fatally injured Kenshin by thrusting a blade or spear into his anus. While historical records showed that Kenshin suffered abdominal problems, modern historians have generally attributed his death to stomach cancer, esophageal cancer, or cerebrovascular disease. \n",
      "=== Psychological warfare ===\n",
      "In battle, the ninja were also used to cause confusion amongst the enemy. A degree of psychological warfare in the capturing of enemy banners can be seen illustrated in the Ōu Eikei Gunki, composed between the 16th and 17th centuries: Within Hataya castle there was a glorious shinobi whose skill was renowned, and one night he entered the enemy camp secretly. He took the flag from Naoe Kanetsugu's guard ... and returned and stood it on a high place on the front gate of the castle.Ninja spread conspiracy theories in states they opposed or wanted to gain power in, and ninja of various opposed and allied social classes and factions indirectly and directly played a role in spreading the popular stereotypes about them in the Tokugawa shogunate to conceal their activities. \n",
      "=== Countermeasures ===\n",
      "A variety of countermeasures were taken to prevent the activities of the ninja. Precautions were often taken against assassinations, such as weapons concealed in the lavatory, or under a removable floorboard. Buildings were constructed with traps and trip wires attached to alarm bells.\n",
      "Japanese castles were designed to be difficult to navigate, with winding routes leading to the inner compound. Blind spots and holes in walls provided constant surveillance of these labyrinthine paths, as exemplified in Himeji Castle. Nijō Castle in Kyoto is constructed with long \"nightingale\" floors, which rested on metal hinges (uguisu-bari) specifically designed to squeak loudly when walked over. Grounds covered with gravel also provided early notice of unwanted intruders, and segregated buildings allowed fires to be better contained. \n",
      "== Training ==\n",
      "The skills required of the ninja have come to be known in modern times as ninjutsu (忍術), but it is unlikely they were previously named under a single discipline, rather distributed among a variety of espionage and survival skills. Some view ninjutsu as evidence that ninja were not simple mercenaries because texts contained not only information on combat training, but also information about daily needs, which even included mining techniques. The guidance provided for daily work also included elements that enable the ninja to understand the martial qualities of even the most menial task. These factors show how the ninjutsu established among the ninja class the fundamental principle of adaptation. The first specialized training began in the mid-15th century, when certain samurai families started to focus on covert warfare, including espionage and assassination. Like the samurai, ninja were born into the profession, where traditions were kept in, and passed down through the family. According to Turnbull, the ninja was trained from childhood, as was also common in samurai families.\n",
      "Outside the expected martial art disciplines, a youth studied survival and scouting techniques, as well as information regarding poisons and explosives. Physical training was also important, which involved long-distance runs, climbing, stealth methods of walking and swimming. A certain degree of knowledge regarding common professions was also required if one was expected to take their form in disguise. Some evidence of medical training can be derived from one account, where an Iga ninja provided first-aid to Ii Naomasa, who was injured by gunfire in the Battle of Sekigahara. Here the ninja reportedly gave Naomasa a \"black medicine\" meant to stop bleeding.\n",
      "With the fall of the Iga and Kōga clans, daimyōs could no longer recruit professional ninja, and were forced to train their own shinobi. The shinobi was considered a real profession, as demonstrated in the 1649 bakufu law on military service, which declared that only daimyōs with an income of over 10,000 koku were allowed to retain shinobi. In the two centuries that followed, a number of ninjutsu manuals were written by descendants of Hattori Hanzō as well as members of the Fujibayashi clan, an offshoot of the Hattori. Major examples include the Ninpiden (1655), the Bansenshūkai (1675), and the Shōninki (1681).\n",
      "Modern schools that claim to train ninjutsu arose from the 1970s, including that of Masaaki Hatsumi (Bujinkan), Stephen K. Hayes (To-Shin Do), and Jinichi Kawakami (Banke Shinobinoden). The lineage and authenticity of these schools are a matter of controversy. \n",
      "=== Tactics ===\n",
      "The ninja did not always work alone. Teamwork techniques exist: For example, in order to scale a wall, a group of ninja may carry each other on their backs, or provide a human platform to assist an individual in reaching greater heights. The Mikawa Go Fudoki gives an account where a coordinated team of attackers used passwords to communicate. The account also gives a case of deception, where the attackers dressed in the same clothes as the defenders, causing much confusion. When a retreat was needed during the Siege of Osaka, ninja were commanded to fire upon friendly troops from behind, causing the troops to charge backwards to attack a perceived enemy. This tactic was used again later on as a method of crowd dispersal.\n",
      "Most ninjutsu techniques recorded in scrolls and manuals revolve around ways to avoid detection, and methods of escape. These techniques were loosely grouped under corresponding natural elements. Some examples are: Hitsuke: The practice of distracting guards by starting a fire away from the ninja's planned point of entry. Falls under \"fire techniques\" (katon-no-jutsu).\n",
      "Tanuki-gakure: The practice of climbing a tree and camouflaging oneself within the foliage. Falls under \"wood techniques\" (mokuton-no-jutsu).\n",
      "Ukigusa-gakure: The practice of throwing duckweed over water to conceal underwater movement. Falls under \"water techniques\" (suiton-no-jutsu).\n",
      "Uzura-gakure: The practice of curling into a ball and remaining motionless to appear like a stone. Falls under \"earth techniques\" (doton-no-jutsu). \n",
      "=== Disguises ===\n",
      "The use of disguises is common and well documented. Disguises came in the form of priests, entertainers, fortune tellers, merchants, rōnin, and monks. The Buke Myōmokushō states, Shinobi-monomi were people used in secret ways, and their duties were to go into the mountains and disguise themselves as firewood gatherers to discover and acquire the news about an enemy's territory... they were particularly expert at travelling in disguise. A mountain ascetic's (yamabushi) attire facilitated travel, as they were common and could travel freely between political boundaries. The loose robes of Buddhist priests also allowed concealed weapons, such as the tantō. Minstrel or sarugaku outfits could have allowed the ninja to spy in enemy buildings without rousing suspicion. Disguises as a komusō, a mendicant monk known for playing the shakuhachi, were also effective, as the large \"basket\" hats traditionally worn by them concealed the head completely. \n",
      "== Equipment ==\n",
      "Ninja used a large variety of tools and weaponry, some of which were commonly known, but others were more specialized. Most were tools used in the infiltration of castles. A wide range of specialized equipment is described and illustrated in the 17th-century Bansenshūkai, including climbing equipment, extending spears, rocket-propelled arrows, and small collapsible boats. \n",
      "=== Outerwear === While the image of a ninja clad in black garb (shinobi shōzoku) is prevalent in popular media, there is no hard evidence for such attire. It is theorized that, instead, it was much more common for the ninja to be disguised as civilians. The popular notion of black clothing may be rooted in artistic convention; early drawings of ninja showed them dressed in black to portray a sense of invisibility. This convention may have been borrowed from the puppet handlers of bunraku theater, who dressed in total black in an effort to simulate props moving independently of their controls. However, it has been put forward by some authorities that black robes, perhaps slightly tainted with red to hide bloodstains, was indeed the sensible garment of choice for infiltration.\n",
      "Clothing used was similar to that of the samurai, but loose garments (such as leggings) were tucked into trousers or secured with belts. The tenugui, a piece of cloth also used in martial arts, had many functions. It could be used to cover the face, form a belt, or assist in climbing.\n",
      "The historicity of armor specifically made for ninja cannot be ascertained. While pieces of light armor purportedly worn by ninja exist and date to the right time, there is no hard evidence of their use in ninja operations. Depictions of famous persons later deemed ninja often show them in samurai armor. There were lightweight concealable types of armour made with kusari (chain armour) and small armor plates such as karuta that could have been worn by ninja including katabira (jackets) made with armour hidden between layers of cloth. Shin and arm guards, along with metal-reinforced hoods are also speculated to make up the ninja's armor. \n",
      "=== Tools === Tools used for infiltration and espionage are some of the most abundant artifacts related to the ninja. Ropes and grappling hooks were common, and were tied to the belt. A collapsible ladder is illustrated in the Bansenshukai, featuring spikes at both ends to anchor the ladder. Spiked or hooked climbing gear worn on the hands and feet also doubled as weapons. Other implements include chisels, hammers, drills, picks, and so forth.\n",
      "The kunai was a heavy pointed tool, possibly derived from the Japanese masonry trowel, which it closely resembles. Although it is often portrayed in popular culture as a weapon, the kunai was primarily used for gouging holes in walls. Knives and small saws (hamagari) were also used to create holes in buildings, where they served as a foothold or a passage of entry. A portable listening device (saoto hikigane) was used to eavesdrop on conversations and detect sounds.\n",
      "A line reel device known as a Toihikinawa (間引縄 / probing pulling rope) was used in pitch dark for finding the distance and route of entry.\n",
      "The mizugumo was a set of wooden shoes supposedly allowing the ninja to walk on water. They were meant to work by distributing the wearer's weight over the shoes' wide bottom surface. The word mizugumo is derived from the native name for the Japanese water spider (Argyroneta aquatica japonica). The mizugumo was featured on the show MythBusters, where it was demonstrated unfit for walking on water. The ukidari, a similar footwear for walking on water, also existed in the form of a flat round bucket, but was probably quite unstable. Inflatable skins and breathing tubes allowed the ninja to stay underwater for longer periods of time.\n",
      "Goshiki-mai (go, five; shiki, color; mai, rice) colored (red, blue, yellow, black, purple) rice grains were used in a code system, and to make trails that could be followed later.\n",
      "Despite the large array of tools available to the ninja, the Bansenshukai warns one not to be overburdened with equipment, stating \"a successful ninja is one who uses but one tool for multiple tasks\". \n",
      "=== Weaponry ===\n",
      "Although shorter swords and daggers were used, the katana was probably the ninja's weapon of choice, and was sometimes carried on the back. The katana had several uses beyond normal combat. In dark places, the scabbard could be extended out of the sword, and used as a long probing device. The sword could also be laid against the wall, where the ninja could use the sword guard (tsuba) to gain a higher foothold. The katana could even be used as a device to stun enemies before attacking them, by putting a combination of red pepper, dirt or dust, and iron filings into the area near the top of the scabbard, so that as the sword was drawn the concoction would fly into the enemy's eyes, stunning him until a lethal blow could be made. While straight swords were used before the invention of the katana, there's no known historical information about the straight ninjatō pre-20th century. The first photograph of a ninjatō appeared in a booklet by Heishichirō Okuse in 1956. A replica of a ninjatō is on display at the Ninja Museum of Igaryu. An array of darts, spikes, knives, and sharp, star-shaped discs were known collectively as shuriken. While not exclusive to the ninja, they were an important part of the arsenal, where they could be thrown in any direction. Bows were used for sharpshooting, and some ninjas' bows were intentionally made smaller than the traditional yumi (longbow). The chain and sickle (kusarigama) was also used by the ninja. This weapon consisted of a weight on one end of a chain, and a sickle (kama) on the other. The weight was swung to injure or disable an opponent, and the sickle used to kill at close range.\n",
      "Explosives introduced from China were known in Japan by the time of the Mongol Invasions in the 13th century. Later, explosives such as hand-held bombs and grenades were adopted by the ninja. Soft-cased bombs were designed to release smoke or poison gas, along with fragmentation explosives packed with iron or ceramic shrapnel.\n",
      "Along with common shinobi buki (ninja weapons), a large assortment of miscellaneous arms were associated with the ninja.Some examples include poison, makibishi (caltrops), shikomizue (cane swords), land mines, fukiya (blowguns), poisoned darts, acid-spurting tubes, and teppo jutsu (firearms). The happō, a small eggshell filled with metsubushi (blinding powder), was also used to facilitate escape. \n",
      "== Legendary abilities ==\n",
      "Superhuman or supernatural powers were often associated with the ninja with a style of Japanese martial arts in ninjutsu. Some legends include flight, invisibility, shapeshifting, teleportation, the ability to \"split\" into multiple bodies (bunshin), the summoning of animals (kuchiyose), and control over the five classical elements. Others included intangibility letting them walk through walls and often combined with invisibility, being roughly 7 imperial feet tall, having three heads, or being ghosts or a type of evil spirit. These fabulous notions have stemmed from popular imagination regarding the ninja's mysterious status, as well as romantic ideas found in later Japanese art of the Edo period. The concept of the ninjas' magical powers were rooted in some ninjas' own disinformation efforts to disseminate fanciful information and their own folklore which leaked into the wider populace and became unintentional misinformation. For example, Nakagawa Shoshunjin, the 17th-century founder of Nakagawa-ryū, claimed in his own writings (Okufuji Monogatari) that he had the ability to transform into birds and animals.\n",
      "Legendary elemental manipulation abilities may be grounded in real tactics, which were categorized by association with forces of nature. For example, the practice of starting fires to cover a ninja's trail falls under katon-no-jutsu (\"fire techniques\"). By dressing in identical clothing, a coordinated team of ninjas could instill the perception of a single assailant being in multiple locations. The ninja's adaption of kites in espionage and warfare is another subject of legends. Accounts exist of ninja being lifted into the air by kites, where they flew over hostile terrain and descended into, or dropped bombs on enemy territory. Kites were indeed used in Japanese warfare, but mostly for the purpose of sending messages and relaying signals. Turnbull suggests that kites lifting a man into midair might have been technically feasible, but states that the use of kites to form a human \"hang glider\" falls squarely in the realm of fantasy. \n",
      "=== Kuji-kiri ===\n",
      "Kuji-kiri is an esoteric practice which, when performed with an array of hand \"seals\" (kuji-in), was meant to allow the ninja to enact superhuman feats.\n",
      "The kuji (\"nine characters\") is a concept originating from Taoism, where it was a string of nine words used in charms and incantations. In China, this tradition mixed with Buddhist beliefs, assigning each of the nine words to a Buddhist deity. The kuji may have arrived in Japan via Buddhism, where it flourished within Shugendō. Here too, each word in the kuji was associated with Buddhist deities, animals from Taoist mythology, and later, Shinto kami. The mudrā, a series of hand symbols representing different Buddhas, was applied to the kuji by Buddhists, possibly through the esoteric Mikkyō teachings. The yamabushi ascetics of Shugendō adopted this practice, using the hand gestures in spiritual, healing, and exorcism rituals. Later, the use of kuji passed onto certain bujutsu (martial arts) and ninjutsu schools, where it was said to have many purposes. The application of kuji to produce a desired effect was called \"cutting\" (kiri) the kuji. Intended effects range from physical and mental concentration, to more incredible claims about rendering an opponent immobile, or even the casting of magical spells. These legends were captured in popular culture, which interpreted the kuji-kiri as a precursor to magical acts. \n",
      "== Foreign ninja ==\n",
      "On February 25, 2018, Yamada Yūji, the professor of Mie University and historian Nakanishi Gō announced that they had identified three people who were successful in early modern Ureshino, including the ninja Benkei Musō (弁慶夢想). Musō is thought to be the same person as Denrinbō Raikei (伝林坊頼慶), the Chinese disciple of Marume Nagayoshi, and possibly a pseudonym. \n",
      "== Famous people ==\n",
      "Many famous people in Japanese history have been associated or identified as ninja, but their status as ninja is difficult to prove and may be the product of later imagination. Rumors surrounding famous warriors, such as Kusunoki Masashige or Minamoto no Yoshitsune sometimes describe them as ninja, but there is little evidence for these claims.\n",
      "Some well known examples include: Kumawakamaru (13th–14th centuries): a youth whose exiled father was ordered to death by the monk Homma Saburō. Kumakawa took his revenge by sneaking into Homma's room while he was asleep, and assassinating him with his own sword. He was son of a high counselor to Emperor Go-Daigo, not ninja. The yamabushi Daizenboh who helped Kumawakamaru's revenge was Suppa, a kind of ninja.\n",
      "Kumawaka (the 16th century): a suppa (ninja) who served Obu Toramasa (1504– 1565), a vassal of Takeda Shingen.\n",
      "Yagyū Munetoshi (1529–1606): a renowned swordsman of the Shinkage-ryū school. Muneyoshi's grandson, Jubei Muneyoshi, told tales of his grandfather's status as a ninja.\n",
      "Hattori Hanzō (1542–1596): a samurai serving under Tokugawa Ieyasu. His ancestry in Iga province, along with ninjutsu manuals published by his descendants have led some sources to define him as a ninja. This depiction is also common in popular culture.\n",
      "Ishikawa Goemon (1558–1594): Goemon reputedly tried to drip poison from a thread into Oda Nobunaga's mouth through a hiding spot in the ceiling, but many fanciful tales exist about Goemon, and this story cannot be confirmed.\n",
      "Fūma Kotarō (d. 1603): a ninja rumored to have killed Hattori Hanzō, with whom he was supposedly rivals. The fictional weapon Fūma shuriken is named after him.\n",
      "Mochizuki Chiyome (16th century): the wife of Mochizuke Moritoki. Chiyome created a school for girls, which taught skills required of geisha, as well as espionage skills.\n",
      "Momochi Sandayū (16th century): a leader of the Iga ninja clans, who supposedly perished during Oda Nobunaga's attack on Iga province. There is some belief that he escaped death and lived as a farmer in Kii Province. Momochi is also a branch of the Hattori clan.\n",
      "Fujibayashi Nagato (16th century): considered to be one of three \"greatest\" Iga jōnin, the other two being Hattori Hanzō and Momochi Sandayū. Fujibayashi's descendants wrote and edited the Bansenshukai.\n",
      "Katō Danzō (1503–1569): a famed 16th-century ninja master during the Sengoku period who was also known as \"Flying Katō\".\n",
      "Tateoka Doshun (16th century): a purported Iga ninja during the Sengoku period.\n",
      "Karasawa Genba (16th century): a samurai of the Sengoku period, in the 16th century of the common era, who served as an important retainer of the Sanada clan.\n",
      "Wada Koremasa (1536–1571): a powerful Kōka samurai ninja who in 1568 allied with the Ashikaga shogunate and Oda Nobunaga, at which point he relocated to Settsu Province.\n",
      "Shimotsuge no Kizaru (16th century): an influential Iga ninja who in 1560 successfully led an attack on Tōichi Castle.\n",
      "Takino Jurobei (16th century): The commander of some of the final resistance against Oda Nobunaga in his invasion of Iga. Momochi Sandayu, Fujibayashi Nagato no Kami, and Hattori Hanzō served as his officers. \n",
      "== In popular culture == The image of the ninja entered popular culture in the Edo period, when folktales and plays about ninja were conceived. Stories about the ninja are usually based on historical figures. For instance, many similar tales exist about a daimyō challenging a ninja to prove his worth, usually by stealing his pillow or weapon while he slept. Novels were written about the ninja, such as Jiraiya Gōketsu Monogatari, which was also made into a kabuki play. Fictional figures such as Sarutobi Sasuke would eventually make their way into comics and television, where they have come to enjoy a culture hero status outside their original mediums.\n",
      "Ninja appear in many forms of Japanese and Western popular media, including books (Kōga Ninpōchō), movies (Enter the Ninja, Revenge of the Ninja, Ninja Assassin), television (Akakage, The Master, Ninja Warrior), video games (Shinobi, Ninja Gaiden, Tenchu, Sekiro, Ghost of Tsushima), anime (Naruto, Ninja Scroll, Gatchaman), manga (Basilisk, Ninja Hattori-kun, Azumi), Western animation (Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu) and American comic books (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). From ancient Japan to the modern world media, popular depictions range from the realistic to the fantastically exaggerated, both fundamentally and aesthetically. \n",

      "Kakashi Hatake (Japanese: はたけ カカシ, Hepburn: Hatake Kakashi) is a fictional character and one of the main protagonists in the Naruto manga and anime series created by Masashi Kishimoto. In the story, Kakashi is the teacher of Team 7, consisting of the series' primary characters, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, and Sakura Haruno.  Kakashi's past has been extensively explored in the series, resulting in a gaiden being devoted to his past experiences. Kakashi has appeared in several pieces of Naruto media, the featured films in the series, the original video animations, and the video games.\n",
      "Kakashi is depicted in Naruto as an eccentric but highly skilled shinobi for the Hidden Leaf Village. Initially cold and calculated due to the suicide of his father, Sakumo, Kakashi eventually began to warm up in his youth with the help of his teammate Obito Uchiha, while they are under the tutelage of Naruto's father Minato Namikaze. It is through Obito that Kakashi obtains the Uchiha clan's Sharingan (which originally only contained 1 tomoe), which he uses to copy the abilities of his opponents and make his own, but also drains his energy. Following the deaths of all of his squadmates, unaware of Obito's survival, Kakashi is eventually given charge of Team 7 due to his connections with Minato and the Uchiha, and through them is able to finally have the family he never had. He is initially portrayed as a detached and apathetic figure, but as the series progresses, his loyalty to his friends, students, and the village becomes increasingly apparent.\n",
      "Kakashi was originally created by Kishimoto to be a harsh teacher but the author decided to avoid that. Instead, he made him more generous to calm his students in difficult situations to the point of giving him feminine traits. Kakashi's design gave Kishimoto difficulties as a result of having most of his face covered and as a result it was difficult to show his emotions. For the anime series, he is voiced by Kazuhiko Inoue in Japanese and Dave Wittenberg in the English dub.\n",
      "Numerous anime and manga publications have praised and criticized Kakashi's character. Although he has been noted to be an echo of similar detached shōnen manga characters, the duality of Kakashi's apathetic and serious sides have been praised. Kakashi has been highly popular with the Naruto reader base, placing high in several popularity polls. Merchandise based on Kakashi has also been released, including key chains and plush dolls. \n",
      "== Creation ==\n",
      "Masashi Kishimoto originally intended for Kakashi to debut in the second chapter of the Naruto manga, appearing prior to the other members of Team 7. This Kakashi was designed as a laid back but very skilled ninja that ended his sentences with the polite \"de gozaru\" in the Japanese versions of the series. After speaking with his editor, Kishimoto pushed this debut back, allowing him to better develop Kakashi and the rest of Team 7. Despite this, Kakashi retains many of his original personality traits, being easygoing, unfazed by the actions of others, and eyes appearing to be half-asleep. Kishimoto feels that this makes Kakashi a compelling leader and helps to keep the diverse members of Team 7 unified. Early in the making of the series, Kakashi was designed as a samurai but he was not sure what the character would do in the manga. Thinking about how the protagonists' teacher would behave, Kishimoto envisioned him as a rude adult. However, he was not happy with this type of personality so he rewrote it to a more laid back person. He found this portrayal funny but still made him hot-blooded for serious situations. As the manga continued, he changed his speech pattern and gave it a laid back touch, with kindness and a woman-like. There was no model for Kakashi; Kishimoto wanted to write a calm teacher who would help his students in complicated situations.\n",
      "Because he acts as a link between the other main characters of the series, Kakashi is rarely featured prominently in promotional artwork, instead appearing in the background while his students are the focus. In an interview in Shōnen Jump's, Kishimoto said that if he were to make an extra story from the manga with a different character, such character would be Kakashi. In early 2014, Kishimoto commented he wanted to reveal Kakashi's face but was not sure whether it would be in the manga or an upcoming movie. The Raikiri, one of Kakashi's most common techniques, had a different name, but the author forgot it. Nevertheless, he found the name Raikiri fitting for this lightning-based technique. Kakashi's Sharingan (写輪眼, lit. \"Copy Wheel Eye\", English manga: \"Mirror Wheel Eye\") was introduced to give the character mystery as only members from the Uchiha clan could possess it. By chapter 16 of the manga, Kishimoto had already decided how Kakashi obtained the Sharingan. He also added that Kakashi's face was difficult to draw since it is covered by a mask. In April 2015, Kishimoto revealed Kakashi's face for the first time during an exhibition.\n",
      "When deciding upon Kakashi's name, Kishimoto considered a number of possibilities: Kuwa (クワ, \"hoe\"), Kama (カマ, \"scythe\"), Botan (ボタン, \"peony\"), Enoki (エノキ, a nettle tree), and Kakashi (カカシ, \"scarecrow\"). He eventually decided upon Kakashi, and remains glad that he did to this day. In keeping with the meaning of his name, scarecrows are occasionally used to represent Kakashi; Naruto, for example, uses a scarecrow that is dressed like Kakashi to help him train for a combat test between the two. Likewise, scarecrows are at times added to the background of scenes in which Kakashi appears, as is the case with the cover of the Naruto manga volume three.\n",
      "In animated versions of the manga, Kakashi has been voiced by Kazuhiko Inoue in Japanese. Inoue was surprised about Kakashi's popularity within the Naruto fans and expected people to continue supporting him. In an interview, Dave Wittenberg, who does the voice acting for Kakashi in the English dub, comments that he feels he is similar to the character since he tends to have one eye open at a time and he becomes angry if he is interrupted while reading. He also added that what he likes most about Kakashi is his relation with his students, noting him to be \"a very nice person\". \n",

      "Kakashi Hatake is introduced as the Jonin (elite ninja) leader in charge of Team 7, a new ninja team including Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. He first appears as a carefree character and tends to lose track of time, being frequently late to his appointments as a result. However, when testing his students, Kakashi reveals himself as a strong opponent to the point of fighting while reading Make Out (イチャイチャ, Icha Icha) series of erotic novels. Kakashi is renowned throughout the Naruto world for the use of his Sharingan, which he received from his teammate Obito Uchiha, and is revered as the ninja who has copied over a thousand jutsus, earning him the moniker \"Copy Ninja Kakashi\" (コピー忍者のカカシ, Kopī Ninja no Kakashi) and \"Kakashi of the Sharingan\" (写輪眼のカカシ, Sharingan no Kakashi). The Sharingan grants him the ability to mimic the movements and jutsu of others. Although most of Kakashi's abilities were acquired with his Sharingan, he also invented the Chidori (千鳥, lit. \"One Thousand Birds\") and its Lightning Blade variation, a collection of lightning chakra in one's hand that uses the Sharingan's visual ability to lock onto a target. When first forming Team 7, Kakashi does not take them as his students until instilling in them the concept of teamwork even if they have to break the rules he gave them. Kakashi continues to further this philosophy for the duration of Part I upon Sasuke Uchiha but is unable to get through to him before the latter's defection from Konoha. Kakashi also reluctantly participates in various challenges by his childhood friend Might Guy who considers Kakashi his rival.\n",
      "Kakashi's background is explored in Kakashi Gaiden, a six chapter series that divides the gap between Part I and II of the manga. Kakashi is the son of Sakumo Hatake, one of the most powerful shinobi Konoha ever produced, renowned throughout the ninja world as \"White Fang of the Leaf\". Kakashi was himself a child prodigy and, during the ninja academy years, was hailed as the best of his generation. Following his father's suicide after a failed mission, Kakashi adopted the philosophy that the success of a mission must always come first, over the welfare of his comrades. Kakashi is assigned by his teacher, Minato Namikaze, to lead a mission that would turn the current war in Konoha's favor. When his teammate, Rin Nohara, is captured by enemy ninja, his other teammate, Obito Uchiha, convinces him to rescue her. After finding Rin, an enemy-induced cave-in crushed Obito's right half. As his dying wish, Obito has Rin implant his newly acquired Sharingan into Kakashi's freshly damaged eye socket as a parting gift. His new eye in place, Kakashi flees with Rin as the cave collapses, completing their mission. Shortly after this event, Kakashi has to rescue Rin, who is kidnapped by Kirigakure, again; however, he learns that the Kiri, under the influence of Madara Uchiha, have made Rin the host of the Three Tails, Isobu. Rin requests Kakashi kill her so she may not be used as part of a Trojan Horse scheme against Konoha, but Kakashi is reluctant. She eventually forces herself on the way of Kakashi's Lightning Blade that he originally directed at the pursuing Hidden Mist ninja, killing her. An anime exclusive flashback arc in Naruto Shippuden covered Kakashi coping with what he endured during the war as he becomes an ANBU operative during Minato's time as Hokage and influences Yamato into becoming a member of the ANBU as well. Once relieved of duty in the ANBU, Kakashi becomes a Genin instructor prior to the events of Part I. Two-and-a-half years later in Part II, Kakashi reforms Team 7, with new arrival Sai in Sasuke's place. During the gap in time, Kakashi hones the Mangekyo Sharingan (万華鏡写輪眼, Mangekyō Sharingan, lit. \"Kaleidoscope Copy Wheel Eye\") gained from Rin's death to master the Kamui ability that allows him to send any targeted object to another dimension. Because his students are now capable of taking care of themselves, Kakashi takes a more active role in battles, particularly those with the criminal organization Akatsuki. When the Akatsuki leader, Pain, invades Konoha, Kakashi engages him in battle, and dies from exhausting all his energy. However, after his confrontation with Naruto, Pain decides to use all of his remaining power to revive all those killed in the battle at Konoha, including Kakashi. Following a brief encounter with Tobi, the Akatsuki's true leader, Kakashi becomes one of the generals to participate in the war against Tobi's army. As Naruto and Killer Bee continue to battle against Tobi and his forces, Kakashi and Guy arrive to join the fight. During the encounter, Kakashi learns that Tobi is Obito, who in fact had survived his apparent death and had committed to destroying the world order that allowed their friend's demise; Kakashi is left greatly stunned and horrified at Obito's actions. Despite the guilt for what Obito has become, Kakashi is encouraged by Naruto to continue fighting and the battle ends with Kakashi impaling Obito. When Naruto is nearly killed by Madara, Kakashi and a redeemed Obito join forces to protect Naruto by spiriting him off into the latter's dimension to be healed. After Kakashi loses his Sharingan, Naruto uses his new-found abilities to restore his original eye. Kakashi finds himself temporarily infused by the chakra-based spirit of Obito as he gains his friend's full Sharingan abilities and a Susanoo to help his team defeat Kaguya. Kakashi Hatake is the commander of the third battle unit in fourth great ninja war. Following the conclusion of the war, Kakashi is named by Tsunade as her successor, the Sixth Hokage, with his first act being to pardon Sasuke for his crimes. He holds this title for many years before finally passing it to Naruto, as revealed in the epilogue. \n",
      "=== Appearances in other media ===\n",
      "Kakashi has made appearances outside of the Naruto anime and manga. He is in ten of the feature films in the series: in the first movie he battles Nadare Rouga and later defeats him, in the third Kakashi battles the hired ninja Ishidate, whom he fights to a standstill, and he later acts as a distraction for his team by battling the minister Shabadaba's soldiers, in the fourth Kakashi fights against a large group of stone soldiers, in the fifth, Kakashi is sent alongside Shikamaru Nara, Sai, and Shino Aburame to investigate the base of the Sky Country, in the sixth, when the threat of war loom over Konoha from the other ninja villages, Kakashi is sent on a suicide mission to defeat a rogue ninja named Hiruko who wants his Sharingan, however, Naruto and Sakura ultimately prevent their teacher from throwing his life away, in the seventh movie, in which a younger Kakashi is a member of a team composed of himself, Minato, Shibi Aburame and Chōza Akimichi to stop Anrokuzan with the help of a time displaced Naruto. In the eighth, he serves as part of the plan to lock Naruto in prison before subsequently helping to break him out, and in the ninth, an alternate version of him with an identical appearance to Guy is shown, to Sakura's dismay. Canonically, in the tenth, he appears as the Sixth Hokage, helping the village while Naruto is away, and in the eleventh he makes a cameo appearance waking up a drowsy Naruto (who is now the Seventh Hokage) shadow clone by tapping him on the head with a book.\n",
      "Kakashi is also present in all four of the original video animations produced for the series, helping Naruto and Konohamaru Sarutobi to find a four leaf clover in the first original video animation, joining his team in escorting a ninja named Shibuki to his village in the second, participating in a tournament in the third, and working with Team 7 in the fourth one. A light novel titled Kakashi Hiden: Lightning in the Icy Sky, written by Akira Higashiyama and illustrated by Kishimoto, focuses on the early days of Kakashi's appointment as the Sixth Hokage, in which he has to stop a terror plan conducted by a pair of Kirigakure ninja, who plan to take control of a newly unveiled airborne ship to stage a jailbreak of a notorious criminal, in the process learning about the pair's tragic reason for doing so. In the anime sequel of Naruto Shippuden, Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Kakashi makes minor appearances until testing the young main characters during a test to see if they can become ninjas.\n",
      "Kakashi is a playable character in all Naruto video games, including the Clash of Ninja series and the Ultimate Ninja series. In some games, he is able to use his Sharingan in combat, often as a different character with the ability activated, and in other games, he is available in his ANBU attire. An upcoming light novel titled Kakashi Hiden will focus on the character. \n",
      "== Reception ==\n",
      "Kakashi has ranked within the top five characters in every official Weekly Shōnen Jump popularity poll, acquiring the first position, as the most popular character, several times. In the most recent poll, he ranked third, with Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha acquiring the top two positions. In the Anime Awards 2006 from About.com, Kakashi won in the category \"Best Supporting Male Character\". He was also a nominee during the first \"Nickelodeon Magazine Comics Awards\" in the category \"Best Hair in Comics\", losing to Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes. In an Oricon poll of \"manga master\", Kakashi was third with 8.4% of the votes. Merchandise based on Kakashi's character has also been released, including plush dolls, key chains, and a limited edition figurine.\n",
      "Several publications for manga, anime, video games, and other related media have provided praise and criticism on Kakashi's character. Christopher A. Born regards Kakashi's teaching of Team 7 to work as a team, even if they have to break the rules, to be reinforcing the Confucian values of the \"importance of benevolence and reciprocity\". IGN noted the duality of Kakashi's serious persona in combat and his laid back, apathetic countenance when dealing with his students, but accepted that he is one of the most popular characters in the series. They also commented that Kakashi is one of the more popular characters they have seen cosplayed at anime conventions. Active Anime celebrated Kakashi's abilities, noting that he fell into the overall theme of characters hiding detailed personalities and secrets. T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews derided Kakashi as a stereotypical \"Man of Mystery\" seen in other shōnen manga, but praised him as being \"much more interesting\" than the three main characters, and felt that for all intents and purposes, the show could be renamed simply \"Kakashi\". Mania Entertainment's Dani Moure likes how Kakashi fits into Team 7 because he is a \"hilarious character in that sometimes he doesn't seem all that bothered about things and yet is so masterful of his craft.\" Chris Beveridge from the site stated that Kakashi is his favorite character from the series because of his personality and praised his fight against Pain, and that after its ending, the character gets \"a very humanizing moment\", making the episode from the battle stand out. Manga author Yoshihiro Togashi found Kakashi's first battle against his students as one of the first series' moments that impressed him due to how the difference in strength between them was shown by just making Kakashi read a book during the fight. IGN ranked him as the 15th greatest anime character of all time, saying that \"He's a complex character, with an iconic character design and a laid back attitude that just exudes cool.\" Amy McNulty from Anime News Network highly praised Kakashi's fight against Obito Uchiha due to its animation and the references to the two fighters' childhoods. In 2014, IGN listed him as the best Naruto character when the series ended.\n",
      "Kakashi's portrayal in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations attracted negative responses by Anime News Network. His rude demeanor during the ninja graduation exams was criticized as the reviewer noted Boruto did not deserve such poor treatment. In a latter review, ANN criticized the poor advice he gives to Sasuke when his former student is trying to bond with his daughter, Sarada Uchiha, making it unsuitable comic relief. \n",

      "Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts: the first is set in Naruto's pre-teen years (volumes 1–27), and the second in his teens (volumes 28–72). The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).\n",
      "Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from September 1999 to November 2014, with its chapters collected in 72 tankōbon volumes. Viz Media licensed the manga for North American production and serialized Naruto in their digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. Part I of the manga was adapted into an anime television series by Pierrot and Aniplex, which ran for 220 episodes from October 2002 to February 2007 on TV Tokyo. A second series, which adapts material from Part II of the manga, is titled Naruto: Shippuden and ran on TV Tokyo for 500 episodes from February 2007 to March 2017. Pierrot also developed 11 animated films and 12 original video animations (OVAs). The franchise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards developed by several companies. The story of Naruto continues in Boruto, where Naruto's son Boruto Uzumaki creates his own ninja way instead of following his father's.\n",
      "Naruto is one of the best-selling manga series of all time, having 250 million copies in circulation worldwide in 47 countries and regions, with 153 million copies in Japan alone and remaining 97 million copies elsewhere. It has become one of Viz Media's best-selling manga series; their English translations of the volumes have appeared on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller list several times, and the seventh volume won a Quill Award in 2006. Reviewers praised the manga's character development, storylines, and action sequences, though some felt the latter slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga, which has a coming-of-age theme, makes use of cultural references from Japanese mythology and Confucianism. \n",
      "== Plot == \n",
      "=== Part I === A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire, one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze, at the cost of his life, seals the fox inside the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, making him a host of the beast. The Third Hokage returns from retirement to become the leader of Konoha again. Naruto is often scorned by Konoha's villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Due to a decree by the Third Hokage forbidding any mention of these events, Naruto learns nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to him. Naruto defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the respect of his teacher, Iruka Umino.\n",
      "Shortly afterward, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with Sasuke Uchiha, against whom he often competes, and Sakura Haruno, on whom he has a crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced sensei, the elite ninja Kakashi Hatake. Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7 completes missions requested by the villagers, ranging from doing chores and being bodyguards to performing assassinations.\n",
      "After several missions, including a major one in the Land of Waves, Kakashi allows Team 7 to take a ninja exam, enabling them to advance to a higher rank and take on more difficult missions, known as Chunin Exams. During the exams, Orochimaru, a wanted criminal, invades Konoha and kills the Third Hokage for revenge. Jiraiya, one of the three legendary ninjas, declines the title of Fifth Hokage and searches with Naruto for Tsunade whom he chooses to become Fifth Hokage instead.\n",
      "During the search, it is revealed that Orochimaru wishes to train Sasuke because of his powerful genetic heritage, the Sharingan. After Sasuke attempts and fails to kill his older brother Itachi, who had showed up in Konoha to kidnap Naruto, he joins Orochimaru, hoping to gain from him the strength needed to kill Itachi. The story takes a turn when Sasuke leaves the village: Tsunade sends a group of ninja, including Naruto, to retrieve Sasuke, but Naruto is unable to persuade or force him to come back. Naruto and Sakura do not give up on Sasuke; Naruto leaves Konoha to receive training from Jiraiya to prepare himself for the next time he encounters Sasuke, while Sakura becomes Tsunade's apprentice. \n",
      "=== Part II === Two and a half years later, Naruto returns from his training with Jiraiya. The Akatsuki starts kidnapping the hosts of the powerful Tailed Beasts. Team 7 and other Leaf ninja fight against them and search for their teammate Sasuke. The Akatsuki succeeds in capturing and extracting seven of the Tailed Beasts, killing all the hosts except Gaara, who is now the Kazekage. Meanwhile, Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and faces Itachi to take revenge. After Itachi dies in battle, Sasuke learns from the Akatsuki founder Tobi that Itachi had been ordered by Konoha's superiors to destroy his clan to prevent a coup; he accepted, on the condition that Sasuke would be spared. Devastated by this revelation, Sasuke joins the Akatsuki to destroy Konoha in revenge. As Konoha ninjas defeat several Akatsuki members, the Akatsuki figurehead leader, Nagato, kills Jiraiya and devastates Konoha, but Naruto defeats and redeems him, earning the village's respect and admiration.\n",
      "With Nagato's death, Tobi, disguised as Madara Uchiha (one of Konoha's founding fathers), announces that he wants to capture all nine Tailed Beasts to cast an illusion powerful enough to control all humanity and achieve world peace. The leaders of the five ninja villages refuse to help him and instead join forces to confront his faction and allies. That decision results in a Fourth Shinobi World War between the combined armies of the Five Great Countries (known as the Allied Shinobi Forces) and Akatsuki's forces of zombie-like ninjas. The Five Kage try to keep Naruto, unaware of the war, in a secret island turtle near Kumogakure (Hidden Cloud Village), but Naruto finds out and escapes from the island with Killer Bee, the host of the Eight-Tails. At that time, Naruto—along with the help of Killer Bee—gains control of his Tailed Beast and the two of them head for the battlefield.\n",
      "During the conflict, it is revealed that Tobi is Obito Uchiha, a former teammate of Kakashi's who was thought to be dead. The real Madara saved Obito's life, and they have since collaborated. As Sasuke learns the history of Konoha, including the circumstances that led to his clan's downfall, he decides to protect the village and rejoins Naruto and Sakura to thwart Madara and Obito's plans. However, Madara's body ends up possessed by Kaguya Otsutsuki, an ancient princess who intends to subdue all humanity. A reformed Obito sacrifices himself to help Team 7 stop her. Once Kaguya is sealed, Madara dies as well. Sasuke takes advantage of the situation and takes control of all the Tailed Beasts, as he reveals his goal of ending the current village system. Naruto confronts Sasuke to dissuade him from his plan, and after they almost kill each other in a final battle, Sasuke admits defeat and reforms. After the war, Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage and pardons Sasuke for his crimes. Years later, Kakashi steps down while Naruto marries Hinata Hyuga and becomes the Seventh Hokage, raising the next generation. \n",

      "=== Development ===\n",
      "In 1995, Shueisha released Karakuri, a one-shot manga by Masashi Kishimoto that earned an honorable mention in the Hop Step Award in 1996. Kishimoto was unsatisfied with his subsequent drafts for a follow-up, and decided to work on another project. The new project was originally going to feature Naruto as a chef, but this version never made it to print. Kishimoto originally wanted to make Naruto a child who could transform into a fox, so he created a one-shot of Naruto for the summer 1997 issue of Akamaru Jump based on the idea. Despite the positive feedback it received in a readers' poll, Kishimoto was unhappy with the art and the story, so he rewrote it as a story about ninjas.\n",
      "The first eight chapters of Naruto were planned before it appeared in Weekly Shōnen Jump, and these chapters originally devoted many panels of intricate art to illustrating the Konoha village. By the time Naruto debuted, the background art was sparse, instead emphasizing the characters. Though Kishimoto had concerns that chakra (the energy source used by the ninjas in Naruto) made the series too Japanese, he still believed it is an enjoyable read. Kishimoto is a fan of Godzilla, and the tailed beasts mythology was introduced because Kishimoto wanted an excuse to draw monsters. He has said that the central theme in Part I of Naruto is how people accept each other, citing Naruto's development across the series as an example.\n",
      "For Part II of the manga, Kishimoto tried to keep the panel layouts and the plot easy for the reader to follow, and avoid \"overdo[ing] the typical manga-style\". He considers that his drawing style has changed from \"the classic manga look to something a bit more realistic.\" Because of wishing to end the arc involving Sasuke Uchiha's search for his brother, Itachi, in a single volume, Kishimoto decided that volume 43 should include more chapters than regular volumes. As a result, Kishimoto apologized to readers for this since volume 43 was more expensive than regular volumes. \n",
      "=== Characters === When he created Naruto, Kishimoto looked to other shōnen manga as influences for his work and tried to make his characters unique, while basing the story on Japanese culture. The separation of the characters into different teams was intended to give each group a particular flavor. Kishimoto wanted each member to have a high level of aptitude in one skill and be talentless in another. He found it difficult to write about romance, but emphasized it more in Part II of the manga, beginning with volume 28. He introduced villains into the story to have them act as a counterpoint to his characters' moral values and clearly illustrate their differences. As a result of how the younger characters were significantly weaker than the villains, Kishimoto made the ellipsis in order to have them age and become stronger during this time. \n",
      "=== Setting ===\n",
      "Kishimoto made use of the Chinese zodiac tradition, which had a long-standing presence in Japan; the zodiac hand signs originate from this. When Kishimoto was creating the primary setting of the Naruto manga, he concentrated initially on the designs for the village of Konoha. The idea of the setting came to him \"pretty spontaneously without much thought\", but admits that the scenery became based on his home in the Japanese prefecture of Okayama. Since the storyline does not specify when it is set, he was able to include modern elements in the series such as convenience stores. He considered including automobiles, planes and simple computers, but excluded projectile weapons and vehicles from the plot. \n",
      "=== Conclusion ===\n",
      "Masashi Kishimoto's home was close to Hiroshima where his grandfather lived. He would often tell his grandson stories of war and how it was related to grudges. In retrospect, Kishimoto commented he could not criticize anyone as a result of the war based on it was built. Upon further researching, Kishimoto decided to create world war story arc for the manga's finale. However, unlike the stories he heard from his grandfather, Kishimoto wanted to give the war covered in Naruto a more hopeful feeling. Nagato's arc paved the way for the ending of Naruto to occur. Nagato stood out as a villain due to suffering war and killing Naruto's mentor Jiraiya. Understanding the fears of war, Naruto's characterization was made more complex for him to experience the Fourth Great Shinobi War. These events end with Naruto forgiving Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato in the final battle. \n",
      "Due to unknown issues, the series' finale was delayed. Once volume 66 was released, Kishimoto commented he reached a moment from the narrative involving something he always wanted to draw. When serialization began, Kishimoto decided the ending would feature a fight between two characters: Naruto and Sasuke. However, the writer felt the two were not equals as the former was not a victim of war like the latter whose family was killed to stop a possible civil war. \n",
      "Kishimoto chose Hinata Hyuga as Naruto's romantic partner from the early stages of the manga, since Hinata had always respected and admired Naruto even before the series' beginning, and Kishimoto felt this meant the two of them could build a relationship. When Hinata first appeared, Kishimoto thought of expanding romantic plotlines. but decided to leave Naruto's maturation through romance as an idea for the film 2014 The Last: Naruto the Movie where he worked alongside screenwriter Maruo Kyozuka, a writer more skilled at the theme of romance. Similarly, the title character's relationship with his first son, Boruto, was explored furthermore in the 2015 film Boruto: Naruto the Movie to end Naruto's growth as the character had become an adult, but it was briefly shown in the manga's finale. \n",
      "== Media == \n",

      "The manga has 250 million copies in circulation worldwide, making it one of the best-selling manga series in history. More than half of the total circulation were in Japan, with the remaining circulation from 46 countries and regions. It has become one of North American publisher Viz Media's best-selling manga series; their translation of the series appeared on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller lists several times. It was included in the fiction section of Teacher Librarian's recommended list for 2008, and School Library Journal described it as an essential manga for school libraries.  Volume 28 of the manga reached seventeenth place in the USA Today Booklist in its first week of release in March 2008, only two places short of the record for a manga, held by Fruits Basket. The volume had one of the biggest debut weeks of any manga in years, becoming the top-selling manga volume of 2008 and the second best-selling book in North America. In 2010, Viz, the publisher, commented on the loyalty of readers, who reliably continued to buy the manga as the volume count went over 40. \n",
      "=== Critical response ===\n",
      "Several reviewers commented on the balance between fight scenes and plot development; A. E. Sparrow of IGN and Casey Brienza of Anime News Network felt that the result was a strong storyline, but Carl Kimlinger, also writing for the same website, suggested that there were too many fights, which slowed down the plot. Kimlinger liked the character designs, and approved of the fight scenes themselves which also drew positive comments from Rik Spanjers, who felt that the excitement of the scenes depends on Kishimoto's skill in depicting action. Javier Lugo, writing for Manga Life, agreed, describing the artwork as \"dramatic, exciting, and just right for the story he's telling\". Briana Lawrence from Mania Entertainment describes the growth of the characters gave Part II an adult feel. Writing for IGN, Ramsey Isler called Jutsu one of the most entertaining concepts in Naruto, stating as well that their diversity, complex signs required for techniques, the unique physical features, and the sheer destructive power of Ninjutsu are the elements that have made the series widely popular.\n",
      "In a review of volume 28 Brienza also praised Part II's storyline and characterization, though she commented that not every volume reached a high level of quality. The fights across the Part II received praise, most notably Naruto's and Sasuke's, resulting in major changes into their character arcs. Meanwhile, the final battle between the two characters in the finale earned major praise for the choreography and art provided as well as how in depth the two's personalities were shown in the aftermath. Some writers criticized Kaguya being the least entertaining villain, making the showdown between Naruto and Sasuke more appealing as a result. The finale earned nearly perfect scores from both Anime News Network and Comic Book Bin, with the latter acclaiming the popularity of the title character.\n",
      "Responding to Naruto's success, Kishimoto said in Naruto Collector Winter 2007/2008 that he was \"very glad that the American audience has accepted and understood ninja. It shows that the American audience has good taste [...] because it means they can accept something previously unfamiliar to them.\" Gō Itō, a professor in the manga department of Tokyo Polytechnic University, compared the series' development to the manga of Dragon Ball, saying that both manga present good illustrations of three-dimensional body movements that capture the characters' martial arts very well. Gō felt readers could empathize with the characters in Naruto via their inner monologue during battles. The series also influenced the movie Scott Pilgrim vs. The World with director Edgar Wright saying he was inspired by how whenever there is a \"killer move\" in the manga, there is an impact in the background following any technique's usage.\n",
      "When the manga ended, multiple authors from the magazine expressed congratulations to Kishimoto's work. The fight scenes in general earned acclaim for how well written they are, something game developer CyberConnect2 took into account when developing the Naruto games. Christel Hoolans, managing director director of Kana and Le Lombard, called Naruto the first long-running series after Dragon Ball to become a classic in France. \n",
      "=== Awards and accolades ===\n",
      "Naruto won the Quill Award for graphic novel in 2006. In April 2007, volume 14 earned Viz the Manga Trade Paperback of the Year Gem Award from Diamond Comic Distributors. The manga was nominated for Favorite Manga Series in Nickelodeon Magazine's 2009 Comics Awards. It won the 16th Spanish Manga Barcelona award for the shonen category in 2010. In 2015, the manga was nominated for the 19th Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize. Masashi Kishimoto was the winner of Rookie of the Year for the series in the Japanese government's Agency for Cultural Affairs 2014 Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology Fine Arts Recommendation Awards. On TV Asahi's Manga Sōsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150,000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, Naruto ranked seventh. \n",
      "=== Themes ===\n",
      "Amy Plumb argues that Kishimoto's use of references to Japanese mythology in Naruto is intended to add further layers to the story. Kishimoto expects his readers to decode the references, which allows him to avoid direct explanations. One example is Itachi, who has three ninja techniques named after Shinto deities: Tsukiyomi, Amaterasu, and Susano-o. Plumb also cites Sasuke's clan's heraldic symbol, a fan known as an uchiwa. These fans are used in Japanese myths to exorcise evil, by blowing it away; Sasuke discovers late in the series that he has the ability to \"blow away\" the influence of the Nine-Tailed Fox on Naruto. Foxes (kitsune tsuki) are tricksters in Japanese mythology, and in some stories, they take over human bodies; Plumb comments on the obvious similarities to the Nine-Tail sealed in Naruto, and the pranks Naruto plays.\n",
      "Christopher A. Born notes that the Naruto storyline contains traditional Confucian values, and suggests that students who analyse manga such as Naruto and Bleach will learn more about Confucianism than they would from studying its abstract ideas. Norman Melchor Robles Jr. evaluated the portrayal of both positive and negative ideas in Naruto by counting words in the script which were associated with either violence or positive values; he found that a small majority of tagged words were violent, but commented that the portrayal of violence seemed organized to show how positive strategies on the part of the protagonists could overcome the violence. Sheuo Hui Gan considers the series to have a set of \"traditional ethical values\". She also compares the treatment of alienation in Naruto, which Naruto overcomes by joining his society, to the portrayal of alienation in Akira and Neon Genesis Evangelion, where the main characters remain alienated.\n",
      "Naruto has been described by several critics as a coming-of-age story. Psychologist Lawrence C. Rubin suggests that the storylines would appeal to readers of any age who have lost loved ones, or are having difficulty finding friends, or who are in other situations shown in the series. In Yukari Fujimoto's view, as the characters mature, they show respect to the adults who have raised and taught them, making it a conservative storyline in comparison to other manga of the same time period such as One Piece and Air Gear. Rik Spanjers sees the difference between Sasuke (a loner) and Naruto (an optimist) as tragic, arguing that the contrast between the two protagonists' approach to the world is fundamental to the plot: \"Naruto's strength grows as he gains more loved ones to protect, while Sasuke remains alone and is increasingly absorbed by his quest for revenge\". Omote Tomoyuki points out that there are many comic moments in the story despite the difficulties Naruto finds himself in, but the comic elements diminish dramatically over time as Naruto grows into a teenager, particularly once Part II begins. Shōnen Jump began to carry comedies such as Gintama and Reborn! from 2003 onwards, and in Tomoyuki's view this is part of the reason for the change in emphasis: Naruto \"was not supposed to provide laughter anymore\".\n",
      "Fujimoto argues that the story has overly traditional gender roles, noting \"[...] its representations suggest that men are men and women are women and that they differ naturally regarding aptitude and vocation\". For example, the girls initially outperform the boys in the Ninja Academy, but \"once the boys get serious, the girls cannot keep pace\". Fujimoto points out that this does not upset Sakura, who is now surpassed by Naruto. Character development based on female roles, when it does occur, again uses stereotypical roles: Tsunade, for example, a middle-aged woman with large breasts, is a clear mother figure, and when she teaches Sakura to be a medical ninja, which requires special skills possessed only by women, the story reinforces the idea that women only belong on the battlefield as healers. Tsunade herself, who is a figure of authority in Naruto, is portrayed as ridiculous in a way that men in the same position are not. Fujimoto suggests this presentation of women may explain why the female characters are often the most disliked characters among readers of the manga. \n",
      "== Naruto run == The Naruto run, or ninja run, is a running style based on the way the characters run leaning forward with their arms outstretched behind their backs. It became popular in 2017 when groups worldwide organized events to run like Naruto characters, especially on anniversaries of the series. On June 27, 2019, Matty Roberts posted a satirical event called \"Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us\" on Facebook where he wrote \"We will all meet up at the Area 51 Alien Center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry. If we naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets. Let's see them aliens.\" This quickly became an Internet meme, resulting in nationwide alerts and warnings issued by Nevada law enforcement and the U.S. Air Force to not go to Area 51. \n",

      "The Naruto (Japanese: ナルト) manga and anime series features an extensive cast of characters created by Masashi Kishimoto. The series takes place in a fictional universe where countries vie for power by employing ninja who can use special techniques and abilities in combat. The storyline is divided into two parts, simply named Part I and Part II, with the latter taking place two-and-a-half years after the conclusion of Part I. It is followed by the sequel series Boruto: Naruto Next Generations by Ukyō Kodachi, which continues where the epilogue of the first series left off. The series' storyline follows the adventures of a group of young ninja from the village of Konohagakure (Village Hidden in the Tree Leaves).\n",
      "The eponymous character of the first series is Naruto Uzumaki, an energetic ninja who wishes to become Hokage, the leader of Konohagakure and holds a monster called the Nine Tails in his body. During the early part of the series, Naruto is assigned to Team 7, in which he meets his rival Sasuke Uchiha, a taciturn and highly skilled \"genius\" of the Uchiha clan; Sakura Haruno, who is infatuated with Sasuke and has Naruto's attention and Kakashi Hatake, the quiet and mysterious leader of the team. Over the course of the series, seeking out Sasuke when he ran away from the village, Naruto interacts with and befriends several fellow ninja in Konohagakure and other villages. He also encounters the series' antagonists, including Orochimaru, a former ninja of Konohagakure scheming to destroy his former home, as well as the elite ninja of the criminal organization Akatsuki who seek out jinchuriki like Gaara for the tailed beasts.\n",
      "The eponymous character of the second series is Boruto Uzumaki, the son of Naruto and Hinata Hyuga who is assigned to Team Konohamaru also known as Team 7, which includes Sasuke and Sakura's daughter – Sarada Uchiha, Orochimaru's artificially created son – Mitsuki and the group's leader – Konohamaru, the Third Hokage's grandson whom Naruto befriended as a child. Subsequently, Sarada is promoted to leader of the team in place of Konohamaru and joins them Kawaki, a young boy with a traumatic past who is taken in by the Uzumaki family, thus becoming the adopted son of Naruto and the adoptive brother of Boruto.\n",
      "As Kishimoto developed the series, he created the three primary characters as a basis for the designs of the other three-person teams. He also used characters in other shōnen manga as references in his design of the characters, a decision that was criticized by several anime and manga publications. The characters that Kishimoto developed, however, were praised for incorporating many of the better aspects of previous shōnen characters, although many publications lamented the perceived lack of growth beyond such stereotypes. The visual presentation of the characters was commented on by reviewers, with both praise and criticism given to Kishimoto's work in the manga and anime adaptations. \n",
      "== Creation and conception ==\n",
      "When Masashi Kishimoto was originally creating the Naruto series, he looked to other shōnen manga for inspiration while still attempting to make his characters as unique as possible. Kishimoto cites Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball series as one of these influences, noting that Goku, the protagonist of Dragon Ball, was a key factor when creating Naruto Uzumaki due to his energetic and mischievous personality. To complement Naruto, Kishimoto worked on creating a rival that was a \"cool genius\", as he believed this was \"the archetypal rival character\". After reviewing different manga for ideas, he ultimately developed Sasuke Uchiha. When creating the primary heroine, Kishimoto admitted, \"I don't have a definite image of what a heroine should be\". He eventually created Sakura Haruno, emphasizing \"her energy and flirtatious spirit\" as her primary characteristics. These three characters would be the mold for the other three main Naruto teams.\n",
      "The separation of the characters into different teams was intended to give each group a specific flavor. Kishimoto wished for each team member to be \"extreme\", having a high amount of aptitude in one given attribute, yet talentless in another. This approach was used to make each team perform best when individual members worked together to overcome their weaknesses. Having watched tokusatsu dramas as a child, Kishimoto wished for his teams to be different from the superhero teams in these dramas, dismissing the value of a team in which all the teammates were \"strong to the point of perfection\". Kishimoto notes that the different roles the characters assume is similar to many role-playing games, and \"each character stands out better that way\".\n",
      "Kishimoto inserted villains into the story to counteract the lead characters' moral values. He stated that this focus on illustrating the difference in values is central to his creation of villains to the point that, \"I don't really think about them in combat\". The villains' physical appearances were also embellished to differentiate them from other characters, making it easier for a reader to follow the story and identify the villains, even in heated battle scenes. Kishimoto noted that making the villains \"flamboyant\" with a \"showy costume\" is \"one of my guiding principles\", as well as making them \"more memorable\".\n",
      "When drawing the characters, Kishimoto consistently follows a five-step process: concept and rough sketch, drafting, inking, shading, and coloring. These steps are followed when he is drawing the manga and making the color illustrations that commonly adorn the cover of tankōbon, the cover of the Weekly Shōnen Jump, or other media, but the toolkit he uses occasionally changes. For instance, he used an airbrush for one illustration for a Weekly Shōnen Jump cover, but decided not to use it for future drawings largely due to the cleanup required. \n",

      "=== Naruto ===\n",
      "The protagonists of the Naruto series are Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura Haruno, and Kakashi Hatake, who form \"Team 7\" (第7班, Dainanahan) of Konohagakure. After Sasuke Uchiha's defection and Naruto's departure from Konohagakure at the end of Part I, the team disbands. During Part II, the team reforms as \"Team Kakashi\" (カカシ班, Kakashi-Han) with two new members: Sai, who occupies Sasuke's position, and Yamato, who becomes the acting Captain.[ch. 285] During the Fourth Great Ninja War, Team 7 reunites to fight Madara Uchiha and then Kaguya Ōtsutsuki when she possesses the former. Once the War is over, Naruto and Sasuke have their final battle that allow them to resolve their issues with their group fully reunited soon after. \n",
      "==== Naruto Uzumaki ==== Naruto Uzumaki (うずまき ナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is the title character and main protagonist of the franchise. He was the first character created by Kishimoto during the conception of the series and was designed with many traits from other shōnen characters. He is often shunned by the Konohagakure villagers, as he is the host of Kurama, the Nine-Tailed Fox that attacked Konoha.[ch. 2] He became a ninja after training hard and being held back a few years in the Ninja Academy, learning ninjutsu and taijutsu skills, and compensates for this with his cheerful and boisterous personality as he developed his catchphrase \"Believe it!\" (～だってばよ, dattebayo), vowing to never give up on any goal he sets. In particular, Naruto has ambitions of becoming Hokage, the strongest ninja leader of Konohagakure, to gain the villagers' respect and be able to protect them. During a battle as a ninja, Naruto has mastered powerful various ninjutsu skills and abilities including the ability to create a massive and several clones of himself known as \"Shadow Clone Jutsu\", the ability to use his wind nature as he's able to master a powerful spiral chakra sphere known as the \"Rasengan\" for the purposes of the offense, and other numerous abilities like using Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra that increases his speed, strength, agility, and even whenever Naruto was enraged and goes feral but later in Part II he manage to control the Nine Tails' chakra. Over the course of the series, Naruto befriends many foreign and Konoha people and eventually claims a sizable positive impact on their lives, which grants him worldwide fame.[ch.. 450] Naruto eventually achieves his dream of becoming Hokage, marries Hinata Hyuga and has two children named Boruto Uzumaki and Himawari Uzumaki.[ch.. 700] Naruto is voiced by Junko Takeuchi in Japanese, and by Maile Flanagan in English. \n",
      "==== Sasuke Uchiha ==== Sasuke Uchiha (うちは サスケ, Uchiha Sasuke) is Naruto's rival and best friend. He was designed by Kishimoto as the \"cool genius\" since he felt this was an integral part of an ideal rivalry. Sasuke's older brother, Itachi Uchiha, killed the rest of their family.[ch. 224] Because of this, Sasuke's sole desire is to kill his brother, and he develops a cold and withdrawn personality, seeing people as tools to further his goals, although also gaining the affection of most of the girls he knows, much to his annoyance. After he becomes a member of Team 7, Sasuke seems to begin considering his teammates precious to the point of risking his life to protect them, while focusing on revenge less than at the start of the series. When during the battle, Sasuke is a taijutsu expert and has mastered his ability to manipulate numerous fire techniques including known as \"Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu\", manipulating a fury of lightning known as \"Chidori\" and as a member of the Uchiha clan, he uses the Sharingan that allows him to senses the opponent's moves and attacks. Following an encounter and a subsequent defeat at the hands of his brother in Part I, however, Sasuke severs his ties and leaves the village to seek more power from Orochimaru. By the events of the Boruto franchise, Sasuke has become a vigilante investigating the Otsutsuki clan for Konohagakure and takes Boruto under his wing. Sasuke is voiced by Noriaki Sugiyama in the Japanese anime, while his English voice actor is Yuri Lowenthal. \n",
      "==== Sakura Haruno ==== Sakura Haruno (春野 サクラ, Haruno Sakura) is a member of Team 7. While creating the character, Kishimoto has admitted that he had little perception of what an ideal girl should be like. As a child, Sakura was teased by other children because of her large forehead, a feature Kishimoto tried to emphasize in Sakura's appearance. She was comforted by Ino Yamanaka and the two developed a friendship. However, as the two grew, they became increasingly distant due to their shared affection for Sasuke Uchiha. As a kunoichi, Sakura possesses superier strength to unleash her powerful punch towards the opponents when she is enraged by saying \"Cha!\" (しゃーんなろー！, Shānnarō!) and as a medical ninja, she can heal every wounds whenever they are injured. During the early moments of Part I, Sakura is infatuated with Sasuke and resents Naruto Uzumaki, although Sasuke views her as \"annoying\" and Naruto has feelings for her.[ch. 3] Her perception on Naruto eventually changes, however, and she comes to see him as a friend, while her feelings for Sasuke grow into deep love. In the Japanese anime, her voice actress is Chie Nakamura, and she is voiced by Kate Higgins in the English adaptation. \n",
      "==== Kakashi Hatake ==== Kakashi Hatake is the easygoing, smart leader of team 7, consisting of Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. Kakashi had a dark past, but is unaffected by it as an adult. He was a very vital key for Naruto's success, training him to be a great ninja. Like Sasuke, Kakashi is also a master of the Sharingan, which he gained as a present from his late friend, Obito Uchiha, and can manipulate \"Lightning Blade\" similar to Sasuke's Chidori. Facing Obito after learning he survived and became apprentice of Madara's, Kakashi's original eye was restored late into series's second half and briefing regaining the Sharingan when Obito aids him in spirit to help in the fight against Kaguya. Kakashi succeeds Tsunade as the Sixth Hokage after the Fourth Great Ninja War have ended, with Naruto succeeding him years later. \n",
      "=== Boruto: Naruto Next Generations ===\n",
      "The protagonists of the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations series are Naruto and Hinata's son Boruto Uzumaki, Sasuke and Sakura's daughter Sarada Uchiha, Orochimaru's son Mitsuki, and Konohamaru Sarutobi who form \"Team Konohamaru\" (木ノ葉丸班, Konohamaru-Han). Prior to their series, Konohamaru was a supporting character in the Naruto series while Boruto, Sarada, and Mitsuki were introduced in the Naruto epilogue.[ch. 700] \n",
      "==== Boruto Uzumaki ==== Boruto Uzumaki (うずまき ボルト, Uzumaki Boruto) is the son of Naruto Uzumaki and Hinata Hyuga who attends Konoha's ninja academy, inheriting his paternal family's short blond hair, blue eyes and \"Believe it!\" (だってばさ, dattebasa) verbal tic. He also inherits his maternal family's Gentle Fist technique despite not inheriting the Byakugan, unlike his sister Himawari. Just as his father pulled pranks to have his existence acknowledged, Boruto commits mischief to get his father's attention after his rise to Hokage, such as defacing the Hokage Monument during the events of the series epilogue. Boruto also admires his father's rival and friend Sasuke, seeking his training in order to surpass his father, later being accepted as his student.[ch. 700] In Boruto: Naruto the Movie, and its retellings, Boruto joins the Chunin Exams with his best friend Shikadai and their teammates, and attempts to cheat his way through the exams. When Naruto gets abducted by Momoshiki, Boruto makes peace with his father and helps him and Sasuke defeat the Otsutsuki, and is branded by the dying entity with a mark called the Kama. He resolves to take Sasuke's path to aid the Hokage from the shadows. While able to use a Rasengan, Boruto accidentally develops the Vanishing Rasengan as a signature attack. Boruto can activate a Byakugan-like dojutsu in his right eye, though not at will. In the Japanese version, Boruto is voiced by Kokoro Kikuchi in The Last: Naruto the Movie and by Yuuko Sanpei in all subsequent appearances. In the English version, he is voiced by Maile Flanagan in The Last and by Amanda C. Miller in all subsequent appearances. \n",
      "==== Sarada Uchiha ==== Sarada Uchiha (うちは サラダ, Uchiha Sarada) is the daughter of Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. She seems to have inherited traits from both her parents, like her mother's \"Cha!\" (しゃーんなろー!, Shānnarō!) verbal tic and her father's aloofness and reluctance to acknowledge and commend others. Sarada is the central character of Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring, searching for her estranged father while mistakenly feeling she and Sakura are not related. Gaining her Sharingan in the process, but not having a good first impression of her father Sasuke, Sarada feels hurt and betrayed when she incorrectly suspects being Karin's biological child as the two wear similar glasses. While Naruto helps her realize that family is not a matter of blood, Sarada eventually learns that Sakura is her biological mother as Karin later explains she was Sakura's midwife. Before leaving again, Sasuke shows Sarada how much he loves her by poking her forehead, and promises to come home soon. Having admired Naruto and his dedication to his village, Sarada makes it her goal to become the next Hokage. Sarada is voiced by Kokoro Kikuchi in Japanese, while in the English version she is voiced by Laura Bailey in Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 and by Cherami Leigh in all subsequent appearances. \n",
      "==== Mitsuki ==== Mitsuki (ミツキ) is a teammate of Boruto and Sarada, a mysterious boy with a calm mind and a penchant for making snide remarks. His backstory is explored in Naruto Gaiden: The Road Illuminated by the Full Moon, which reveals that Mitsuki is an artificial human created by Orochimaru, and a modified clone of him, gaining the name Mitsuki from the fact that he is a \"vessel\" (杯, tsuki) for the \"snake\" (巳, mi) to inhabit. He tested by Orochimaru and another of his creations called Log (ログ, Rogu) to determine his allegiance; Mitsuki decided to follow his own path as the \"moon\" instead of a vessel, setting out toward the Hidden Leaf to find his \"sun\": Boruto Uzumaki. Mitsuki can extend his limbs by using chakra to dislocate his joints, while the experimentation by Orochimaru allows him to access Sage Mode. He is voiced by Ryūichi Kijima in Japanese and by Robbie Daymond in the English dub. \n",
      "==== Kawaki ==== Kawaki (カワキ, Kawaki) is a tattooed youth who became a member of Kara after being brought by Jigen from a drunkard father, bearing a tattoo of the Roman numeral IX under his left eye and bestowed a Kama mark by Jigen to be made into a living weapon for Kara. He was heavily modified with microscopic Shinobi-Ware implanted in his body that give him abilities similar to Jugo's Sage Transformation in altering his physiology at a cellular level. For reasons yet to be revealed, Kawaki left Kara and encountered Boruto who brings him to the Hidden Leaf as he lives with the Uzumaki family. The two would end up becoming enemies as hinted in prologue of the Boruto series, an older Kawaki appearing to have perpetrated Konoha's destruction as he confronts an older Boruto while declaring the age of shinobi has come to an end. His voice actor in the Japanese anime is Yūma Uchida and Michael Schwalbe voices him in the English dub. \n",
      "==== Konohamaru Sarutobi ====\n",
      "Konohamaru Sarutobi (猿飛 木ノ葉丸, Sarutobi Konohamaru), named after Konohagakure, is the grandson of the Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi. He strives to replace his grandfather as Hokage so the villagers will recognize him by name, not simply as the Hokage's grandson. He looks to Naruto as a mentor in this quest, emulating his work ethic, determination, and signature jutsu such as the Rasengan and the Sexy Jutsu. Konohamaru insists, however, that he will only become Hokage after Naruto has been Hokage first.[ch. 2] By the series epilogue, Konohamaru has ascended to the rank of jonin and is the captain of Team Konohamaru. Konohamaru's design caused great difficulties for Masashi Kishimoto; he intended for Konohamaru to look like a \"punk\" smaller than Naruto, yet all of his attempts resulted in a recreation of Naruto. He eventually gave Konohamaru small, angry-looking eyes and was instantly happy with the design.[vol. 2:26] While voiced in the Japanese anime by Ikue Ōtani and by Akiko Koike as a stand-in, Konohamaru's adult self is voiced by Hidenori Takahashi. In the English version, Colleen O'Shaughnessey voices Konohamaru's pre-adult self, and Max Mittelman voices his adult self. \n",

The members of Team 8 primarily concentrate on tracking, with each of the members' unique abilities used in this role. During Part II, Team 8, excluding Kurenai due to her pregnancy, joins Naruto Uzumaki and Team 7 in their search for Itachi Uchiha and Sasuke Uchiha.[ch. 354] \n",
      "==== Hinata Hyuga ==== Hinata Hyuga (日向 ヒナタ, Hyūga Hinata) is a member of Team 8 who suffers from a lack of self-confidence. Though born of the Hyuga clan's main house and raised to become future head of the clan, Hinata's shyness and inability to stand up for herself resulted in the strong disapproval of her father Hiashi after being defeated by her younger sister Hanabi, who became their father's successor. Hinata was then disowned by Hiashi and placed in the care of Kurenai Yuhi.[ch. 78] Under Kurenai's guidance, Hinata began training her strength in both skill and will in order to prove her worth to her father.[ch. 238] Hinata's growing self-confidence mainly comes from her long-standing admiration for Naruto, as she is inspired by his enthusiasm and unyielding determination to never give up. As the series progresses, Hinata's admiration towards Naruto eventually grows into love. During Part II, Hinata confesses her feelings to Naruto while protecting him from Pain and later assists him during the Allied Ninjas' battle with the Ten-Tails.[ch. 437, 615] Following the end of the Fourth Great Ninja War, and the events of The Last: Naruto the Movie where she carries out the will of her ancestor Hamura Ōtsutsuki by helping Naruto stop Toneri, Hinata marries Naruto and they have two children by the series epilogue. Her voice actress in the Japanese anime is Nana Mizuki, and her English voice actress is Stephanie Sheh. \n",
      "==== Kiba Inuzuka ====\n",
      "Kiba Inuzuka (犬塚 キバ, Inuzuka Kiba) is a member of Team 8 from the Inuzuka Clan, a group of ninja with canine characteristics who train alongside their ninja dog (忍犬, ninken) partners. In stark contrast to his teammates, Kiba is brash, impulsive, and loud-mouthed, and considers Naruto a rival after Naruto defeats him in the Chunin Exams. Despite this, he is very protective of his teammates, and displays the same loyalty to Akamaru, unwilling to abandon him and putting himself in harm's way for Akamaru's sake.[ch. 204] In exchange for Kiba's devotion, Akamaru fights with him in battle; he uses his heightened senses to Kiba's advantage, and helps double-team opponents with volleys of physical attacks. Since Akamaru is naturally better equipped for combat, Kiba usually modifies his own abilities at the start of a battle, growing claws and running on four limbs to increase his speed.[ch. 75] He can also drastically increase his sense of smell, and by the second half of the series he can use it to track things dogs cannot.[ch. 364] In the series epilogue, Kiba ends up living with Tamaki, the granddaughter of the Uchiha Clan's supporter Granny Cat, and the two house various dogs and cats. Kiba's voice actor in the Japanese anime is Kōsuke Toriumi, and his English voice actor is Kyle Hebert. \n",
      "==== Akamaru ====\n",
      "Akamaru (赤丸) is Kiba Inuzuka's ninja dog, best friend, and constant companion. At the start of the series, Kiba carries Akamaru around on his head or inside his jacket. By Part II of the Naruto storyline, Akamaru grows large enough for Kiba to ride atop his back, though Kiba comically fails to notice this drastic difference.[ch. 282] With his heightened sense of smell, hearing, and ability to detect others' chakra levels, Akamaru acts as a valuable tool for Kiba in hostile situations. To help Kiba beat track of opponents, Akamaru uses scent marking, though in battle he relies on Kiba to provide the chakra for the combination attacks they execute, which require Akamaru to transform into a clone of Kiba.[ch. 203] In the series epilogue, an aged Akamaru fathers a litter of puppies, among the assortment of animals living with Kiba and Tamaki. In the original Japanese anime, Akamaru is voiced by Junko Takeuchi, also the voice actor for Naruto Uzumaki, and Kōsuke Toriumi, who voices Kiba, when Akamaru transforms into a clone of Kiba. In the English adaptation of the anime, Akamaru's vocal effects as a puppy are provided by Jamie Simone though Kyle Hebert provided the voice of Akamaru when he took Kiba's form. \n",

During a battle, Shino directs his bugs towards an opponent, boxing them in and absorbing their chakra once they have been surrounded. Shino's merciless tendencies towards opponents, as well as his attachment to and collection of insects,[ch. 172] have caused other characters to label him as \"creepy\".[ch. 70] Nevertheless, Shino cares deeply for his teammates, being acutely aware of their inner workings and always regretting when he is unable to help them;[ch. 238] he is also capable of childish emotions, as shown in the anime when he sulks after Naruto (returning after two and a half years) fails to remember his name or recognize him. In the series epilogue, Shino becomes a Ninja Academy teacher. In the Japanese anime, his voice actor is Shinji Kawada. His first voice actor in the English anime was Sam Riegel, who voiced Shino in episodes 23 and 24, but in all following appearances, he has been voiced by Derek Stephen Prince. \n",

The fathers of the three team members Choji Akimichi, Shikamaru Nara, and Ino Yamanaka were also on a team together, and both generations refer to their team using the moniker \"Ino-Shika-Cho\".[ch. 137] During Part II, Asuma is slain in an encounter with members of Akatsuki, and Kakashi Hatake briefly assumes leadership of the team to hunt down those responsible for Asuma's death.[ch. 331] In the series epilogue, the three living members of Team Asuma are training their children to become the next \"Ino-Shika-Cho\" group. \n",
      "==== Shikamaru Nara ==== Shikamaru Nara (奈良 シカマル, Nara Shikamaru) is a member of Team 10. Creator Kishimoto has noted that he \"likes\" Shikamaru due to his easygoing nature despite being a genius, and contrasted him against Sasuke Uchiha's intelligent but abrasive personality. Shikamaru's intelligence is such that Asuma Sarutobi, Team 10's leader, is never able to defeat Shikamaru at games such as shogi or go, and he can devise complex strategies even in the heat of battle. However, his laziness frequently prevents him from effectively utilizing his intelligence.[ch. 107] Shikamaru is a longtime friend of Choji Akimichi, choosing to look upon Choji as a person without considering his large girth. Despite thinking of Naruto a bit poorly and often getting annoyed by him, he is one of the few people to have acknowledged him as a person rather than the tailed beast in childhood, remaining one of Naruto's close friends since then.[ch. 190] In battle, Shikamaru can manipulate his shadow, and, by extending it into another person's shadow, can force the target to mimic his movements.[ch. 107] In the series epilogue, Shikamaru works as Naruto's advisor and is revealed to have married Temari, who had moved to the Hidden Leaf, and with whom he has a son, Shikadai. In the Japanese anime, Shikamaru's voice actor is Showtaro Morikubo, although Nobutoshi Canna acted as a stand-in for Morikubo in episode 141. His English voice actor is Tom Gibis. \n",

Though his habit of always eating gives him a relatively portly appearance, Choji insists he is not fat, instead using explanations like being \"big-boned\". If someone refers to him as fat, Choji instantly becomes hostile and increases his resolve to battle,[ch. 55] even killing one of the Sound Four during one occurrence. Shikamaru Nara has never found an issue with Choji's weight, instead choosing to look upon Choji's inner strength. Because of this, Choji regards him as his best friend, stating he would willingly give his life to defend Shikamaru.[ch. 190] In battle, Choji can increase the size of his body to improve the amount of damage his strikes deal upon impact.[ch. 189] He can also use his clan's signature Calorie Control (カロリーコントロール, Karorī Kontorōru) which converts his body fat to chakra.[ch. 190] In the series epilogue, Choji has married Karui of the Hidden Cloud Village and they have a daughter Chocho Akimichi.

She is a childhood friend of Sakura Haruno, helping her to develop her own identity and defending her from bullies. When they discovered that they both liked Sasuke Uchiha, their friendship was ended.[ch. 71] The two eventually make amends and rekindle their friendship, but still maintain a competitive attitude toward each other.[ch. 73] In the anime, when Sakura begins to excel in healing techniques, Ino becomes motivated to learn Medical Ninjutsu, hoping to be even more useful to her friends and teammates as an able medical ninja. In terms of combat abilities, Ino specializes in mind-altering techniques. Ino can transfer her consciousness to her target's mind, gaining control over their body and actions which she can then use to attack others, to spy or to immobilize/distract.[ch. 55] She can also communicate telepathically by connecting minds of people around her, and in addition, she is a sensory ninja, able to detect chakra around her. During the death of her father, it was revealed that Ino was raised to embody the title of the 'Purple Buschlover' represented in the Yamanaka Clan's crest, which is a blunt and candid love that treasures bonds. In the series' epilogue, Ino has married Sai and they have a son, Inojin, and become the head of her clan and the Leader of the Village's Sensory Unit as well as the owner of her family's flowershop. In the Japanese anime, her voice actress is Ryōka Yuzuki, and her voice actress in the English adaptation is Colleen O'Shaughnessey. \n",

      "Asuma Sarutobi (猿飛 アスマ, Sarutobi Asuma) was the leader of Team 10 and son of the Third Hokage Hiruzen Sarutobi and uncle of Konohamaru Sarutobi. In battle, Asuma wielded trench knives that he could infuse with his wind nature chakra to extend the blades' length and sharpness.[ch. 317] When he was younger, Asuma had a dispute with his father and briefly left Konohagakure in protest, gaining fame as a member of the Land of Fire's Twelve Guardian Shinobi. Though Asuma eventually returned, gaining the resolve to protect Konoha's next generation from his experiences outside his home, he never completely reconciled with his father by the time of Hiruzen's death.[ch. 314] Asuma was usually seen smoking a cigarette, but would temporarily drop the habit when something was bothering him, such as when his father died.[ch. 321] Among all his students, Asuma shared a particularly close relationship with Shikamaru Nara, often playing go or shogi together.[ch. 107] Asuma frequently appears alongside his childhood friend Kurenai Yuhi, denying having a relation before it is revealed that Kurenai is bearing his child.[ch. 140, 342] After Asuma is killed by Hidan of the criminal organization Akatsuki, Shikamaru inherited his mentor's ideals as he uses his knuckles to defeat Hidan. During the Fourth Great Ninja War, Asuma is brought back with the Reanimation Jutsu to fight for Kabuto before being defeated by his students and sealed until his soul is allowed to return to the afterlife. Asuma's voice actor in the Japanese anime is Jūrōta Kosugi, and he is voiced by Doug Erholtz in the English adaptation. \n",

In Part II, Team Guy joins Team 7 in an attempt to save Gaara from the criminal organization, Akatsuki.[ch. 253] \n",
      "==== Rock Lee ==== Rock Lee (ロック・リー, Rokku Rī) is a member of Team Guy and the favorite student of team leader Might Guy. In the ninja academy, Rock Lee was unable to use ninjutsu or genjutsu techniques, but his persistence impressed Guy. Guy spends much of his free time training with Lee to help him accomplish his dream of becoming a respected ninja by using only taijutsu. Lee has adopted several of Guy's habits because of this, such as his wardrobe and his perseverance.[ch. 84] Guy has taught him a number of powerful, even forbidden, techniques. Because some of these techniques, such as the ability to open the eight chakra gates, can pose a severe risk to Lee's body, he is only permitted to use them to protect something or someone dear to him. During the Chunin Exams, Lee loses use of both his left arm and leg, but his injuries are healed following Tsunade's return to Konoha[ch. 52]. In the Japanese anime, his voice actor is Yoichi Masukawa, and his voice actor is Brian Donovan in English. \n",

      "Neji Hyuga (日向 ネジ, Hyūga Neji) was a member of Team Guy and a child prodigy of the Hyuga clan, as well as Hinata's cousin.[ch. 101] As he was the only ninja of his generation to be promoted to the rank of Jonin during Part II, he frequently acted as leader of his assigned teams and the secondary leader of Team Guy when Might Guy is absent. Though a member of the branch house, Neji displayed his title as a prodigy of the Hyuga throughout the series as a master of his clan's Gentle Fist style of combat that he taught to himself.[ch. 101] Originally, Neji believed in a fatalistic philosophy: that one's destiny is inescapable and that a weak person will always be weak.[ch. 38]\n",
      "After being defeated in the Chunin Exams by Naruto Uzumaki, who defied his own \"fate\", Neji had a change of heart once Uncle Hiashi reveals the full story of his father's death, Hizashi, as an act of self-sacrifice in place of his twin brother. Neji then abandons his belief in determinism and resolves to get strong enough to never lose a battle and change the fates of his loved ones.[ch. 197] As the series progressed, Neji refined his Gentle Fist and devised original variations that either increased their potency or fixed flaws such as the blind spot in his Byakugan.[ch. 197] Neji also remedied the estranged relations between himself and the members of the main house, resulting in his training with Hiashi and Hinata at the end of Part I.[ch. 238] Neji is killed during the Fourth Great Ninja War as he sacrificed himself to protect Naruto and Hinata from Obito Uchiha's attack, telling Naruto that he made the choice to die protecting those dear to him as his father had. Following the war's conclusion, a memorial was held in Neji's honor. Years after the war, Naruto paid tribute to Neji by naming his son Boruto whose name means \"bolt\" while Neji's name means \"screw\". In the Japanese anime, his voice actor is Kōichi Tōchika, and when he is featured as a child, he is voiced by Keiko Nemoto.

Tenten uses this expertise to help Neji Hyuga train his defensive techniques, and she holds him in high regard since he can always block her attacks.[ch. 98] In the series epilogue, Tenten runs her own weapons shop. Her Japanese voice actress is Yukari Tamura, and her English voice actress is Danielle Judovits. \n",
      "==== Might Guy ==== Might Guy (マイト・ガイ, Maito Gai) is the leader of Team Guy who dedicates most of his time to his pupil Rock Lee, who emulates himself in his sensei's image and ideals, including his \"My Rules\" philosophy, which involves setting tough self-imposed penalties for failure in the belief that the punishment will make him stronger.[ch. 180] Like Lee, Guy relies on his mastery of taijutsu, but unlike his pupil he is fully capable of using ninjutsu and genjutsu. He taught Lee many of the techniques he learned from his father Might Duy, such as the ability to unlock the Eight Gates which safely restrict the flow of chakra through the body. When not teaching Lee, Guy is usually found competing with his self-proclaimed childhood rival, Kakashi Hatake. Throughout the series, Kakashi never displays a particular interest in their rivalry, which only further motivates Guy to defeat him.[ch. 65] Guy is an extremely capable ninja as seen in his fight against Itachi Uchiha and his recurring confrontations with Kisame Hoshigaki,[ch. 143] beating him single-handedly on two occasions.[ch. 258][ch. 506] During the Fourth Great Ninja War, Guy is forced to use the Eighth Gate in a failed attempt to defeat Madara. Though Naruto uses the power of the Sage of Six Paths to save his life, Guy's right leg is too damaged to be fully healed. Though he is not wavered from his shinobi career, he remains in a paraplegic state by the events of the epilogue.\n",

Because of their interactions with Naruto Uzumaki, and learning their father was murdered by their supposed ally Orochimaru, the Sand Siblings return as allies of Konohagakure, aiding Naruto's group in their attempts to retrieve Sasuke Uchiha from Orochimaru's forces. Kishimoto changed their costumes for their return due to the difficulty in drawing their original attire, as well as to symbolize their new friendship with Konohagakure.

Before being born, Gaara was made into a weapon by his father by becoming the Jinchuriki of the Tailed Beast Shukaku the One-Tail (一尾の守鶴, Ichibi no Shukaku). This act caused the death of his mother during labor and Gaara was placed in the care of his mother's younger brother. Like any other Jinchuriki and because his sand unconsciously attacked those around him when he was threatened, Gaara was tormented by his fellow villagers as well as his uncle.[ch. 131] Unlike Naruto, however, Gaara comes to see himself as omnipotent and that anyone who challenges him or his power must die. When he battles Naruto during the invasion of Konoha, learning that he is also a Jinchuriki like himself, Gaara's outlook changes as he resolves to help others and he succeeds his deceased father as Sunagakure's Fifth Kazekage during Part II.[ch. 249] Gaara's Japanese voice actor is Akira Ishida and his English voice actor is Liam O'Brien. \n",

He also possesses the large puppet Salamander (山椒魚, Sanshōuo) that provides him with combination defense and offense. After his puppets were destroyed by their creator, Kankuro gains a new puppet in Sasori's lifeless body Scorpion (蠍, Sasori) and modifies it for his use as a normal puppet.

In her time in Konohagakure, Temari is often seen walking with Shikamaru Nara, causing other characters to think they are dating, although both deny this.[ch. 247] In battle, Temari wields a giant iron fan that can create powerful gusts of wind capable of leveling the surrounding landscape. As she is skilled at deducing an opponent's strategies and weaknesses soon after a battle begins, she typically uses her winds to remove parts of the battlefield that might be advantageous to the enemy.[ch. 107] During Part I of the series, Temari is able to use the Summoning Jutsu, in which she can summon a powerful scythe-wielding weasel called Kamatari (カマタリ).[ch. 214] In the series epilogue, Temari is revealed to have moved to the Hidden Leaf and married Shikamaru, with whom she has a son, Shikadai.[ch. 700] Temari's voice actress in the Japanese anime is Romi Park and her English voice actress is Tara Platt. \n",

After a failed coup d'état, wherein he tried to assassinate the Fourth Mizukage, Zabuza and his followers fled the village and began working as mercenary assassins.[ch. 30] He also takes in a young boy, Haku, as his apprentice, mostly treating him as a tool although he ultimately does care for him.[ch. 32] Zabuza is skilled in water-based abilities, but his area of expertise is in assassinations in areas covered by mist.[ch. 26] His talents lead to his commission by a criminal named Gato to kill a man named Tazuna, which he is unable to perform due to interference by Tazuna's bodyguard, Kakashi Hatake. Because he takes too long to complete the task, his contract is revoked, and his employer tries to have Zabuza killed. Having been redeemed by Naruto, Zabuza kills him first, though is mortally wounded and dies soon afterwards.[ch. 32] He is one of the shinobi resurrected by Kabuto to fight on the Akatsuki side and is defeated, being sealed during a rematch with Kakashi.[ch. 516, 524] In the Japanese anime, his voice actor is Unshō Ishizuka, and his English voice actor is Steven Blum. \n",
      "=== Haku ===\n",
      "Haku (白) is Zabuza Momochi's most faithful follower. Before he started working for Zabuza, Haku lived as an orphan. His father killed his mother when it was discovered that Haku possesses a genetic ability, Hyōton (氷遁, lit. \"Ice Release\"), that allows him to mix wind and water elements to create ice,[ch. 24] which was considered a threat. Haku then killed his father. After wandering from place to place, he was found by Zabuza, who recognized Haku's talents and agreed to take him in as a tool. As a result, Haku becomes unquestioningly protective of and loyal to Zabuza, and only by being useful does he find a purpose in life.[ch. 29] Haku later meets Naruto (who mistakes him for a girl) while he is training, and the two bond over their connections. On this same mission, Haku ultimately gives his life in his mission to save his master from Kakashi's Lightning Blade, becoming the first casualty in the series. This is not in vain, however, as a saddened Naruto uses Haku's death to redeem Zabuza.[ch. 30] Episode 17 of the anime greatly expands on Haku's early life, showing the scene where Haku discovered his powers. Haku is resurrected by Kabuto Yakushi later in Part 2 of the series to fight in the Fourth Shinobi World War until being sealed by the Allied Shinobi Forces.[ch. 516, 524] His voice actress in the Japanese anime is Mayumi Asano, and his English voice actress is Susan Dalian. Mona Marshall voiced Haku as a child. \n",
      "=== Orochimaru === Orochimaru (大蛇丸) is a criminal who served as the principal villain of Part I, having previously affiliated with the Akatsuki. He was a former Hidden Leaf ninja and Hiruzen's student alongside his teammates Jiraiya and Tsunade, who are revered as the Legendary Sannin.[ch. 170] Orochimaru's desire for immortality, so he can learn every jutsu in existence, led him to experimenting on fellow ninja before establishing his own ninja village, the Hidden Sound Village, as his personal laboratory, to continue his work while amassing a personal army to destroy Konoha.[ch. 69] His immortality technique involves transferring his consciousness between different host bodies every few years, with his intent to acquire the body of Sasuke Uchiha being his driving motivations throughout most of the series.[ch. 238] Following end of Part II, through kept under watch by Yamato, Orochimaru renounced his personal war against the Hidden Leaf Village. He has since created Mitsuki.\n",
      "Kishimoto emphasized Orochimaru's role as a villain by giving him a \"pasty and sickly\" complexion as part of his theme of distinguishing villains from the protagonists. Because of his different host bodies and the disguises he assumes, a panoply of voice actors are used for Orochimaru; his voice actor for his normal form in the Japanese anime is Kujira, and his corresponding English voice actor is Steven Blum, except in the spin off Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals, where he is voiced by Vic Mignogna. \n",
      "=== Kabuto Yakushi ===\n",
      "Kabuto Yakushi (薬師 カブト, Yakushi Kabuto) is a spy who works as Orochimaru's right hand, though he acts on his own whims. As a child with no memory of his past, Kabuto was found on a battlefield by a nun from Konohagakure who raised him before he was recruited by the Foundation as their spy to infiltrate numerous countries and organizations.[ch. 289, 583] But after being labeled a risk to the Foundation for knowing too many secrets, Kabuto becomes Orochimaru's spy after being promised an identity he can call his own.[ch. 584] Using his former affiliations, and infiltrating the Akatsuki, Kabuto gathers intelligence on Orochimaru's behalf; for instance, he participates in the bi-annual Chunin Exams as a Konoha representative to gather information on his fellow participants.[ch. 88] Highly proficient with medical techniques and genetic manipulation, Kabuto devises means to heal wounds by reactivating dead cells to grow new ones, and can form a scalpel with chakra to deal surgical strikes to his opponents.[ch. 164]\n",
      "In Part II, after his mentor's defeat by Sasuke, Kabuto integrates some of Orochimaru's remains into his body to become powerful enough to not serve anyone again.[ch. 357] Kabuto then masters snake Sage Jutsu while modifying his body with DNA samples of the Sound Five, Jugo, Suigetsu, and Karin to increase his abilities further. After perfecting the Reanimation Jutsu, using it to bring back Madara Uchiha as his personal trump card, Kabuto forces Obito Uchiha into a tenuous alliance with him under the promise that he can have Sasuke upon victory against the Ninja Alliance.[ch. 520] However, during the second day of the Fourth Great Ninja War, Itachi manages to break free of Kabuto's control and force him to end the Reanimation Jutsu with Sasuke's help. The ordeal of being subjected to Itachi's Izanami genjutsu has Kabuto re-evaluate himself and his life, coming to the conclusion that he should save Sasuke. In the war's aftermath, kept under surveillance by the Hidden Leaf, Kabuto returns to run the orphanage where he was held as a kid, together with his adopted brother Urushi. In the Japanese anime, Kabuto is voiced by Nobutoshi Canna, and his English voice actor is Henry Dittman. \n",
      "=== Sound Four === The Sound Four (音隠れの忍四人衆, Otogakure no Shinobi Yonin Shū, lit. \"Hidden Sound Shinobi Four People\", English TV: \"Sound Ninja Four\") are Orochimaru's elite bodyguards. The group was originally known as the \"Sound Five\", but after Kimimaro became bedridden due to his unknown illness, the group resumed calling themselves the Sound Four.[ch. 201] As a group they specialize in barriers, defensive walls, sealing techniques as well as possessing their own individual unique techniques and Curse Marks that increase their strengths.[ch. 184] The group is composed of: Jirobo (次郎坊, Jirōbō), a large, and quick-tempered, man who specializes in absorbing chakra and close-quarters combat.[ch. 187] He is voiced by Kenta Miyake in the Japanese anime, while his English voice actor is Michael Sorich.\n",
      "Kidomaru (鬼童丸, Kidōmaru), a six-armed ninja who can produce spider-webs to fight and specialized in ranged combat.[ch. 192] He is voiced by Susumu Chiba in the Japanese anime, while his English voice actor is Peter Lurie.\n",
      "Sakon and Ukon (左近 - 右近, Sakon to Ukon) are twin brothers who are the strongest of the Sound Four and count as one member due to their ability to merge their bodies with anyone and kill an opponent at a cellular level.[ch. 203,204] Both Sakon and Ukon are voiced by Shunsuke Sakuya in the Japanese anime, while their English voice actor is Brian Beacock.\n",
      "Tayuya (多由也, Tayuya), a female flautist who uses her flute for genjutsu and controlling summoned demons.[ch. 206] She is voiced by Akeno Watanabe in the Japanese anime, while her English voice actress is Kari Wahlgren.\n",
      "Kimimaro (君麻呂, Kimimaro), the last of the Kaguya Clan who has his kin's Kekkei Genkai ability to manipulate his bone structure, called the Shikotsumyaku, became the leader after he defeated the entire group in battle. He is voiced by Toshiyuki Morikawa in the Japanese anime with Makoto Tsumura voicing him as a child. His English voice actor is Keith Silverstein with Kari Wahlgren voicing him as a child.\n",
      "The Sound Four do not become a prominent part of the story until sent by their leader to escort Sasuke Uchiha to him. Even with Kimimaro joining the group to ensure Sasuke's passage to Orochimaru, the Sound Five all died in the process: Jirobo and Kidomaru killed in their respective fights against Chōji Akimichi and Neji Hyūga, Sakon and Ukon taken out by Kankuro as they nearly kill Kiba Inuzuka, Tayuya indirectly killed by Temari as she had the upper hand on Shikamaru Nara, and Kimimaro succumbed to his unknown illness in the midst of his battle against Gaara and Rock Lee.[ch. 184, 217] During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kimimaro is reanimated by Kabuto Yakushi as a pawn to battle against the Allied Shinobi Forces.[ch. 515] In the anime adaptation, unaware that Kabuto brought them back instead of Orochimaru, the Sound Four were also reanimated and were allowed to act on their impulse for revenge against the members of the Sasuke Retrieval group before being defeated. It was also at the time of the war's climax that Kabuto reveals that he assimilated the Sound Five's DNA to access their abilities.[ch. 585] \n",
      "=== Akatsuki === The Akatsuki (暁, lit. \"Dawn\" or \"Daybreak\") is an organization of rogue ninja that serves as the primary antagonistic force of the second part of the Naruto series. It was founded by Yahiko, Nagato and Konan. After Yahiko's death, it was led by Nagato with Obito as his benefactor. The Akatsuki's goal is world peace through the power of the nine Tailed Beasts, with Nagato assuming it would involve mass destruction giving way to a world without war.[ch. 239] To achieve their goal of collecting all nine Tailed Beasts, the Akatsuki recruited several rogue ninjas, including Deidara, Sasori, and Hidan, among other notable Akatsuki members, to join their ranks. The actual goal is for Obito to enact Madara's Project Tsuki no Me (月の眼計画, Tsuki no Me Keikaku, literally \"Eye of the Moon Plan\"), which involves feeding the Tailed Beasts to the Gedo Statue, to revert it into the Ten-Tails with Obito as its Jinchuriki; empowered thus, he would project the Infinite Tsukiyomi on the moon's surface, and bring all life into a utopic illusion. The members of the Akatsuki are ninja who have abandoned their villages, and are considered by their former homes to be S-class criminals, the most powerful and wanted ninja in the Naruto universe. Aside from an attempt by members Itachi Uchiha and Kisame Hoshigaki to capture Kurama (the Nine-Tailed fox sealed within Naruto Uzumaki), the Akatsuki is not prominently featured in Part I.[ch. 143] In Part II, they take a more active role, capturing Gaara and extracting the one-tailed tanuki, Shukaku, from his body, as well as progressively capturing the remaining Tailed Beasts.[ch. 261] Kishimoto called the Akatsuki's members antiheroes as he wished to expand their backgrounds as much as the ones from the series' protagonists, contrasting them with other types of villains. \n",
      "==== Obito Uchiha ==== Obito Uchiha (うちは オビト, Uchiha Obito), also known under his alias Tobi (トビ) is the true leader of the Akatsuki and the primary antagonist for most of Part II. As a child during the Third Great Ninja War, being Kakashi's teammate in Team Minato, Obito was similar to Naruto in both wanting to become Hokage and unrequited love for his teammate Rin. When he and Kakashi rescue Rin after she was kidnapped by Hidden Stone Ninja during a mission, Obito's right side got crushed in a landslide. Obito believed his death was certain and had Rin transplant his left Sharingan into Kakashi to replace the latter's original left eye. Obito finds himself saved by Madara and outfitted with Zetsu prosthetics, and is conditioned to become his apprentice, the ninja arranging Obito to witness Rin's death as a casualty of war by a reluctant Kakashi to break his spirit. Coming to the conclusion that he can use the Tailed Beasts to destroy the current reality and create a utopia, Obito takes up Madara's name following the latter's death while masking his voice. Obito would then arrange similar events for Nagato with Yahiko's death to create the current incarnation of the Akatsuki.[ch. 602, 606] Obito serves a behind-the-scenes role throughout the first half of Part II while revealed to have caused tragedy prior to the series, most notably Kurama's attack on the Hidden Leaf as revenge on his sensei Minato for not protecting Rin.[ch. 501] Other than being able to use his right Sharingan to cast Kamui in a fashion that renders him intangible and lets him teleport over great distances, Obito can use Wood Style attacks as his prosthetics possess Hashirama's cells.[ch. 310, 395] \n",
      "==== Zetsu ====\n",
      "Zetsu (ゼツ) is the only member of the Akatsuki without a bespoke partner, the only nonhuman member, and Obito's right hand man. Originally, Kaguya created a shadow-like parasitic entity known as Black Zetsu (黒ゼツ, Kuro Zetsu) to manipulate her grandson Indra and his descendants throughout history for one of them to manifest a Rinnegan and free his creator. Black Zetsu succeeds with Madara, whom he deceived into believing that he had created the entity. White Zetsu (白ゼツ, Shiro Zetsu) was originally part of an army that Kaguya was assembling to fend off her kinsmen, consisting of humans mutated into drones after being assimilated by the Ten Tails during Kaguya's previous Infinite Tsukuyomi. Black Zetsu and White Zetsu operate in symbiosis, Black Zetsu occasionally argued with his easygoing host. As White Zetsu is an extension of the Shinju, he can merge into the ground or vegetation to quickly travel to a new location, and use spores to create clones of himself or whoever he touches.[ch. 289] This makes Zetsu not only of use to the Akatsuki as a spy, but also to devour bodies of deceased Akatsuki members or those the organization does not want found.[ch. 255, 261] Another of the White Zetsu retrieved from the Gedo Statue, initially referred to as Guruguru (グルグル) due to the spiral-shaped pattern on his body, later named Tobi (トビ), served as an exosuit for Obito while the youth got used to his new body. After White Zetsu is killed by Sasuke during the Fourth Great Ninja War, Black Zetsu goes into hiding, later merging itself onto Obito to force the human to resurrect Madara.[ch. 575, 656] Ultimately, once the Eye of the Moon Plan runs its course, Black Zetsu reveals his true identity and fuses himself onto Madara to convert the human into a new body for Kaguya to inhabit.[ch. 674] Black Zetsu then reveals his role in the conflict between the Senju and Uchiha, while helping Kaguya fight Naruto and Sasuke. He is eventually ripped away from his creator when Naruto severs Kaguya's arm. As Kaguya is sealed away once more, Black Zetsu is thrown by Naruto into the forming moon so he would not make another attempt to free his creator.[ch. 681, 688, 690] Tobi, having participated in the war by encasing Yamato to access his Wood-Style, before ejecting him once the Infinite Tsukiyomi is cast, crumbles away after the jutsu is canceled, with his former captive the only witness to his death.[ch. 699]\n",
      "As Kishimoto originally planned the Akatsuki to be a group of individuals with close to no human characteristics, he decided to make Zetsu half black and half white to emphasize his split personality. In the Japanese anime, Zetsu is voiced by Nobuo Tobita, who also voices the Tobi and the White Zetsu Army. In episode 134 of the English adaptation, Black Zetsu is voiced by Michael Sorich and White Zetsu by Brian Beacock, though both in the English Shippuden anime are voiced by Travis Willingham alongside Tobi and the White Zetsu Army. \n",
      "==== Kisame Hoshigaki ====\n",
      "Kisame Hoshigaki (干柿 鬼鮫, Hoshigaki Kisame) is a former ninja of Kirigakure and partnered to Itachi Uchiha, having a unique appearance with pale blue skin, a gill-like facial structure, and sharp acute angled triangle teeth. While he was loyal to Kirigakure, Kisame was one of the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist, a group of violent ninja that use particularly large swords in battle. His sword, Samehada (鮫肌, \"Sharkskin\" in Shippuden), is a living weapon covered in scales. Although it was covered in bandage like cloth in the Akatsuki arc (while he was travelling with Itachi Uchiha). That can absorb untold amounts of an opponent's chakra. Only allowing those it sees as worthy to wield it, Samehada can provide the user with the chakra it holds, ensuring him an infinite amount of stamina. Kisame himself has massive amounts of chakra,[ch. 142] and by fusing Samehada into him, Kisame can assume a shark-like form that increases his abilities. In battle, he frequently shapes water into the forms of sharks to damage opponents.[ch. 258] After discarding Samehada when it chose Killer Bee over him, Kisame is decapitated by Killer Bee and the Raikage using Double Lariat. It is later revealed that the decapitation was just a shapeshifting technique performed by Zetsu; the real Kisame having hidden inside Samehada.[ch. 487] He attempts to flee from the ninjas but is defeated by Might Guy and captured. Kisame then commits suicide by summoning sharks and allowing them to eat him, but not before using one of them to steal back the information he had compiled and send it to the Akatsuki.[ch. 508] His voice actor in the Japanese anime is Tomoyuki Dan; in English, he is voiced at first by Michael McConnohie, later by Kirk Thornton. \n",
      "==== Konan ====\n",
      "Konan (小南) is the only female ninja in the Akatsuki. As such, Kishimoto originally wanted her to have an obscene appearance showing more of her bust. Being the partner of Pain, Konan was also a pupil under Jiraiya after she was orphaned as a child by one of Amegakure's many wars and forced to fend for herself. Because she serves under Pain, she is referred to by villagers of Amegakure as \"God's angel\". Under Jiraiya, Konan learned to take advantage of her natural talent with origami, using it as a key component in her battle style.[ch. 373, 449] Konan can divide her body into countless sheets of paper, which she controls and reshapes remotely to scout out an area, form weapons for attack, or create wings that mirror her title. While Konan's abilities are restricted when the paper is wet, since paper will cling and lose its stiffness, she is able to use this weakness to her advantage as she implements explosive tags into her paper clones. After Nagato's death, Konan withdraws her position in the Akatsuki and proclaims loyalty to Naruto.[ch. 372] Later, she is confronted by Obito over the location of Nagato's Rinnegan eyes. She fights him in a suicide assault, but is killed after being forced to reveal Nagato's resting place. She last sees the endless rain of Amegakure stop for the first time.[ch. 510] In the Japanese anime, Konan is voiced by Atsuko Tanaka and in the English anime, her voice actress is Dorothy Elias-Fahn. \n",
      "==== Nagato ==== Nagato (長門), primarily known under the alias of Pain (ペイン, Pein), is the recognized leader of the Akatsuki and partner of Konan, with Obito acting as his benefactor.[ch. 510] The \"Pain\" most often seen in the series is the Deva Path, which is actually Nagato's deceased friend, Yahiko (弥彦), one of six animated corpses collectively known as \"The Six Paths of Pain\" (ペイン六道, Pein Rikudō), all controlled by Nagato and using one sixth of his full power.[ch. 378, 419] The Pain Paths are all outfitted with a number of body piercings that serve as a means for Nagato to control them and to give them a \"more dangerous\" appearance in relation to their name's installation. \n",
      "==== Itachi Uchiha ==== Itachi Uchiha (うちは イタチ, Uchiha Itachi) is a former ninja of Konohagakure and the partner of Kisame Hoshigaki. Though having spent his early youth as the prodigy of the Uchiha clan, Itachi is treated as a villain for much of the series. He is initially portrayed as being solely responsible for the killing of his entire clan and family, sparing only his brother, Sasuke Uchiha, with the explanation that he was testing his abilities.[ch. 224] Around the time of his death his villainous role is downplayed; not only is he revealed to offer help to Obito Uchiha in killing the clan, though it is revealed in part two that he performed the massacre under the orders of Konoha's leadership so as to prevent an Uchiha coup d'état.[ch. 400] In the Japanese anime, Itachi's voice actor is Hideo Ishikawa. His first voice actor in the English anime was Skip Stellrecht, who voiced Itachi in episodes 29 and 30, but in all following appearances, he has been voiced by Crispin Freeman. \n",
      "==== Deidara ====\n",
      "Deidara (デイダラ) is a former ninja of Iwagakure, having left the village after bombing it. He was a terrorist bomber-for-hire before Itachi Uchiha forced him to join the Akatsuki. Though he came to embrace the organization, Deidara still holds a grudge against Itachi and all other Uchiha throughout the series, as he feels their Sharingan eyes \"look down on his artwork\".[ch. 359] Upon joining the Akatsuki, he is partnered with Sasori, who is replaced by Tobi after his death. Though he was annoyed by Tobi, Deidara becomes somewhat of a teacher to him, and adopts a genuine care for his well-being.[ch. 366] Both of Deidara's hands have mouths on them that, by infusing clay or other fine-grained minerals with chakra, create \"sculptures\", bombs that explode with varying intensities. Deidara's bombs can take any form he chooses, and from the time of their creation to their detonation, he can animate and control them remotely.[ch. 248] Sasuke Uchiha, Itachi's younger brother, is able to systematically nullify his bombs in combat, and so Deidara transforms himself into a living bomb in a last effort to kill Sasuke and to prove the supremacy of his art, but fails in the attempt.[ch. 363] He is later resurrected by Kabuto for the war against the Shinobi Alliance but is defeated by Kankuro.[ch. 520] His voice actor in the Japanese anime is Katsuhiko Kawamoto. In his cameo appearance in episode 135 of the English adaptation, he is voiced by Quinton Flynn, and in the anime of Shippuden by Roger Craig Smith. \n",
      "==== Hidan ====\n",
      "Hidan (飛段) is the immortal, foul-mouthed, and sadomasochistic partner of Kakuzu and a former ninja of Yugakure, the Village Hidden in Boiling Water. He is a member of the Way of Jashin (ジャシン, lit. \"evil god\") religion which worships a deity of the same name and believes that anything less than death and utter destruction in battle is a sin.[ch. 313] His religion's experimentations have led to the creation of his unique abilities; by consuming an opponent's blood and drawing Jashin's triangular symbol on the ground, Hidan can create a link with his opponent. Once this link is created, any damage done to Hidan's body is reflected on his opponent, allowing him to kill them by giving himself fatal injuries. Though his immortality keeps him from dying or suffer any impairment, Hidan feels his victims' suffering with an excitement bordering on arousal. [ch. 325] After Hidan used this ability to kill Asuma Sarutobi, Shikamaru Nara fights him to avenge his teacher. Their battle culminates in Hidan being blown up, and Shikamaru burying his still-speaking remains in a forest that the Akatsuki will never be able to reach.[ch. 339] As such, Hidan is no longer considered a member by the rest of the Akatsuki.[ch. 353] In the Japanese version of the anime, Hidan is voiced by Masaki Terasoma. In the English version, he is voiced by Chris Edgerly and in Naruto Shippūden: Clash of Ninja Revolution 3 by Wally Wingert. \n",
      "==== Kakuzu ====\n",
      "Kakuzu (角都) is the partner of Hidan and a former ninja of Takigakure, the Village Hidden in the Waterfalls. Kakuzu is motivated by greed, and joins the Akatsuki to seek out valuable bounties. However, his extreme temperament and fits of rage leading to his eventual murder of whomever he was partnered with resulted in his pairing with the immortal Hidan.[ch. 322] When Kakuzu still lived in his village, he was given a very important mission: assassinate Hashirama Senju, the First Hokage. As the strongest shinobi of his time, Hashirama was far too strong for Kakuzu, and the mission failed with Kakuzu barely escaping with his life. Kakuzu returned to his village, and, despite the overwhelming danger and risk he faced, he was dishonoured and severely punished. Gaining a violent hatred for his village because of this unfair treatment, Kakuzu escaped from prison and, in vengeance, stole his village's forbidden techniques, and murdered the village elders (carving out their hearts), becoming a rogue ninja in the process. Kakuzu's body is composed of a large number of black threads, allowing him to reattach any body part, his or another, back onto its owner. The threads are also capable of piercing flesh, which Kakuzu uses to remove the still-beating hearts of his opponents and integrate their hearts into his body to extend his life indefinitely. Kakuzu can store up to four spare hearts in animal masks that are sewn to his back, which can be detached during combat situations to shoot elemental blasts at his opponents, and quickly recalled to his body if he needs a replacement heart.[ch. 336] Kakuzu's hearts are systematically destroyed soon after his introduction by a group of Konohagakure ninja. After Naruto Uzumaki leaves his final heart on the brink of failure, Kakuzu is easily finished off by Kakashi.[ch. 342] After being resurrected by Kabuto, he is sent out to participate in the war until being sealed. In the Japanese anime, Kakuzu's Japanese voice actor is Takaya Hashi and in the English version he is voiced by Fred Tatasciore. \n",

      "Sasori (蠍), primarily known as \"Sasori of the Red Sand\" (赤砂の蠍, Akasuna no Sasori), is a former ninja of Sunagakure and partner of Deidara. When he was a child, Sasori's parents were killed by Sakumo Hatake, also known as the White Fang of Konoha, leaving him in the care of his grandmother, Chiyo, who taught Sasori the art of puppetry to cheer him up after his loss, which he refined to fit his needs over the years. However, motivated by his desire to make works that last forever, Sasori secretly devised a way to convert the corpses of humans into puppets, allowing him to use any ninja abilities they possessed for himself. Leaving Sunagakure in his teenage years, Sasori later kidnapped the Third Kazekage, transforming him into a puppet and using him as his main weapon.[ch. 267] Sasori's desire was to become art, so he converted his own body into a puppet, which essentially gives him eternal life and allows him to control hundreds of puppets at once.[ch. 271] After joining the Akatsuki, Sasori was paired with Orochimaru, and after his desertion, was teamed with Deidara, who looks up to him and his artistic knowledge with reverence.[ch. 248][ch. 263] In the Akatsuki, Sasori spent much time hidden inside Hiruko, a human puppet who served as both weapon and armour, which he adorned with the Akatsuki's robe. After he and Deidara kidnap Gaara, Sasori ends up fighting Sakura and Chiyo, resulting in the destruction of his heart, the only part of his humanity he kept when converting himself to a puppet, resulting in his death. Before dying, he tells Sakura about his rendezvous with one of Orochimaru's henchmen who had been working for him as a spy.[ch. 464] After being resurrected by Kabuto, Sasori fights Kankuro, who convinces him to be at peace with himself. Sasori comes to terms with his life and is able to pass on and rest in peace. In the Japanese anime, Sasori is voiced by Akiko Yajima as a child and by Takahiro Sakurai as an adult. In the English version he is voiced by Kari Wahlgren as a child and as an adult he is voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch.

He is very arrogant about his immense battle prowess. Though he was a childhood friend of Hashirama amidst the conflicts of their respective clan, their friendship ends as a result of the war. As the leader of the Uchiha clan, Madara's overuse of Mangekyo Sharingan blinds him, forcing him to take the eyes of his late younger brother Izuna. This allows Madara to use his newly awakened Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan to continue the ongoing war between the Uchiha and the Senju.[ch. 386] In later years, Hashirama comes forth with a peace offering between the two clans. Though he agrees to have peace with his former rival, Madara feels he would never be accepted by the Senju and loses hope in Hashirama. While working towards this goal, Madara captures Kurama the Nine-Tails and uses him in a scheme to destroy Konoha.[ch. 399, 621] Madara is believed to have been killed by Hashirama's hand, but he survives and goes into hiding while taking a blood sample of Hashirama with him to awake his Rinnegan.[ch. 560] During this time, Madara takes Obito Uchiha as his agent and transplants his Rinnegan into Nagato to be preserved for his eventual revival years later.[ch. 605]\n",
      "During most of the Naruto series, Obito uses the name of \"Madara\", until Kabuto Yakushi finds the real Madara Uchiha and reanimates him to force Obito into an alliance. Despite their agreement, Kabuto summons Madara to fight against the Shinobi Alliance.[ch. 562] Madara manages to sever his connection to Kabuto's technique by using the hand signs of the Reanimation Jutsu, defeating most of the Ninja Alliance forces. Madara manages to fully resurrect as planned by sacrificing Obito, becoming the Ten Tails's host once he regains one of his Rinnegan.[ch. 658, 669, 673] After regaining his other eye, Madara is able to complete the Eye of the Moon Plan before finding himself betrayed by Black Zetsu who proceeds to turn him into a vessel for Kaguya's spirit. [ch. 658, 669, 673] Though freed upon Kaguya being resealed, the ordeal placed a regretful Madara on the verge of death and dies being able to finally make peace with Hashirama. In the Japanese anime, Madara (and Obito in his Madara guise) is voiced by Naoya Uchida while Gou Inoue voices him as a child.

Later learning that some of her chakra passed on into her sons, Hagoromo and Hamura, Kaguya attempts to reclaim that power by merging into the Divine Tree and regress it into the Ten-Tails (十尾, Jūbi). Hagoromo, aided by his brother Hamura, managed to defeat the monster and seal him in his body, becoming the first jinchūriki. Shortly before dying, the Sage decided to divide the demon's chakra into nine parts and, through a technique known as \"perfect Izanagi\" of Yin-Yang, he gave birth to the bodies of the nine tailed beasts into which she infused all of her mother's chakra her. She eventually sealed the Ten-Tails' soulless body with the Chibaku Tensei, trapping him in an enormous mass of rocks, which would later be known as the Moon.

Although Naruto and Minato are noted to have a number of similar physical traits throughout the series, their familial relationship is not revealed until Part II of the series.[ch. 367] He was the student of Jiraiya and the teacher of Kakashi Hatake, Obito Uchiha, and Rin Nohara. The entire village respects Minato as a hero of the village, having perfected Tobirama's Flying Thunder God Jutsu, a method of teleportation with pre-made seals, to earn the title of \"Konoha's Yellow Flash\" (木ノ葉の黄色い閃光, Konoha no Kiiroi Senkō).[ch. 240] Before the start of the series, after battling the mysterious masked ninja who released the Nine-Tails Kurama, Minato siphons Kurama's Yin chakra to weaken the beast to be sealed into Naruto's body in a sacrificial act so that only his son can access the Nine-Tails' yang chakra.[ch. 2] Years later during the Fourth Great Ninja War, Orochimaru releases Minato's soul and reanimates him. Minato and the other Hokage decide to fight alongside Sasuke on the battlefield and defeat Madara Uchiha. Minato reveals his own Nine-Tails Chakra Mode which he later tries to pass to his son. During a battle against Madara, he soon realized that Obito is in fact alive all along and that he was the masked man that was behind Kurama's attack on the Hidden Leaf Village during Naruto's birth. Once the battle is over, Minato is released from the Reanimation Jutsu by Hagoromo and promises Naruto that he will tell Kushina of their son's progress. Kishimoto has expressed desire to make a spin-off series with a younger Minato as the protagonist.  In the Japanese anime, Minato is voiced by Toshiyuki Morikawa with Miyu Irino voicing him as a child. In the English version, his voice actor is Tony Oliver. In 2023, on the occasion of the global poll held for the 20th anniversary of the manga, Minato Namikaze was found to be the most popular character of the franchise. \n",

      "Tsunade (綱手), as well as her former teammates Jiraiya and Orochimaru, is a former student of Hiruzen Sarutobi.[ch. 170] Despite looking like a buxom woman in her twenties, Tsunade is actually an older woman in her fifties who uses a transformation technique to maintain her youthful appearance.[ch. 149] Tsunade is also the granddaughter of Hashirama Senju and Mito Uzumaki with many referring to her by the Japanese honorific \"hime\" (princess). Despite her connections to the first three Hokage, Tsunade hates the position when she is first introduced. After her friend Dan Katō and brother Nawaki Senju die in pursuit of their dreams to become Hokage, she loses faith in the title and the concept of dreams. She regains her faith in both after meeting Naruto Uzumaki, who consistently overcomes any obstacle in his own dreams of being Hokage.[ch. 172] As a result, Tsunade accepts the position of Fifth Hokage (五代目火影, Godaime Hokage) to protect Konohakagure on behalf of everyone she has loved,[ch. 169] also later taking Sakura as her apprentice, much like Orochimaru with Sasuke and Jiraiya with Naruto. By the end of the series, Tsunade retires at the end of the Fourth Great Ninja War and bestows the Hokage title to Kakashi. She is last seen in the epilogue attending a meeting with other recent Kage that have also retired.\n",
      "Despite the importance of her position, Tsunade tends to laze around and avoid her everyday duties, instead leaving them for her assistant Shizune. She does however take her role very seriously in situations where Konoha is in danger, and throughout Part II leads the village in combating the Akatsuki.[ch. 238] Tsunade is a compulsive gambler with terrible luck, though with a rare winning streak perceived by her as a bad omen. Despite her odd personality, Tsunade is a highly talented medical ninja who can heal injuries that most others would consider incurable, and also possesses superhuman strength that allows her to reduce buildings to rubble. The pinnacle of her skills is the Creation Rebirth jutsu and its derived technique, the Strength of a Hundred Technique, which she taught to her disciple Sakura. This way, both Tsunade and Sakura use mitotic regeneration to make them nearly unkillable in battle. In the Japanese anime, Tsunade's voice actress is Masako Katsuki, and her English voice actress is Debi Mae West. In some of the video games, however, her English voice actress is Mary Elizabeth McGlynn. \n",

Kishimoto has commented that out of all master-pupil relationships he has created in the Naruto series, the bond between Naruto and Jiraiya is his favorite, noting that it makes drawing them \"worthwhile\". As a child, Jiraiya was under the tutelage of Hiruzen Sarutobi, along with his teammates, Tsunade and Orochimaru.[ch. 170] Jiraiya is known throughout the Naruto world as the \"Toad Sage\" (蝦蟇仙人, Gama Sennin) due to his toad-related jutsu and knowledge of Sage Jutsu. Prior to Naruto, Jiraiya also trained other pupils like Minato and Nagato due to a prophecy he heard that his pupil would be great man. Although still affiliated with Konoha, Jiraiya is usually traveling to watch over potential threats to his home. Jiraiya's personality is openly lecherous, proudly describes himself as a \"super pervert\" while authoring a series of best-selling adult romance novels.[ch. 91] He also wrote the epic \"Tale of the Gutsy Ninja\", with Naruto named after its protagonist. During Part I, he takes Naruto as his student, and returns him to Konoha in Part II before leaving to investigate the Akatsuki.

However, this resulted in Anko being the only survivor of ten Cursed Seal subjects, and also develop various snake-like abilities.[ch. 50] After Orochimaru abandoned his village, Anko blamed herself and made it her personal goal to eliminate him.

After prematurely arriving to take the examinees to the Forest of Death, she ends up frightening Naruto when he complains about her \"exaggerations\" of the forest.[ch. 45] She also fights Orochimaru in the forest alone when she discovers he is in there. During Part II, Anko is sent by the Allied Shinobi Forces to find and locate Kabuto. However, Kabuto ends up defeating her in battle, and uses her Cursed Seal to fuel his Reanimation Jutsu while she is unconscious. Taka later finds her and uses her Cursed Seal to release Orochimaru, causing the Seal to be cured. In the epilogue, Anko is an instructor at the Academy, having become rather fat.[ch. 700] In Japanese, Anko is voiced by Takako Honda.

Many of the attacks she uses in the series are poison-based, including using concealed poisoned needles or emitting toxic gas from her mouth.[ch. 166] In Part II of the series, Shizune's concern for details causes her to question Tsunade's judgment, creating interference with Tsunade's plans and temporarily straining the relationship between the two.[ch. 282] During Pain's attack on Konohagakure, Shizune is briefly killed when her soul is stripped away as the Human Path interrogates her about Naruto's whereabouts,[ch. 429] though she is revived at the end of the invasion.[ch. 449] She continues to serve as the Hokage's personal assistant well over into Naruto's leadership as the Seventh Hokage in the series epilogue.[ch. 449] In the Japanese anime, her voice actress is Keiko Nemoto, and her English voice actress is Megan Hollingshead. \n",
      "=== Sai ===\n",
      "Sai (サイ) is a ninja who joins Team Kakashi/ Team 7 in Part II, carefully designed by Kishimoto to stand out as Sasuke's replacement by having the two look similar. A member of \"The Foundation\" since he was a child, Sai has been trained to not possess or desire any type of emotion or camaraderie, even after he killed his surrogate brother Shin under Danzo's diabolical orders. He consequently gives people labels based on their status, and his label of Sasuke as a traitor antagonizes Naruto and Sakura. After the two discover his past and warm up to him, however, he begins to crave bonds with other people, which becomes his primary goal in the series.[ch. 303] Sai's attempts to form bonds turn can be humorous as he tries giving pet names to others; however, he often says what he actually thinks of a person, resulting with him choosing names such as \"fatso\" for Choji and \"ugly\" for Sakura. He eventually learns from his mistakes and attempts the opposite approach by calling Ino \"beautiful\", causing Ino to fall for him.[ch. 312] When not making an attempt to bond with others, Sai spends his time painting and drawing, and has produced thousands of works, although he doesn't name any of them. His artistic talents extend to his choice of attacks in battles, as he can infuse chakra with his inking brush to make his drawings come to life.[ch. 283] In the series epilogue, Sai ends up marrying Ino Yamanaka and together they have a son, Inojin.[ch. 700] Sai's voice actor is Satoshi Hino in the Naruto: Shippūden anime, and his English voice actor is Benjamin Diskin except in Rock Lee and his Ninja Pals, where he is voiced by Lucien Dodge. \n",

In the anime, the ordeal erased Yamato's memories as he was taken in by Danzo to serve as a Root operative under the code name Kinoe (甲). After meeting Kakashi, Kinoe would leave Root and join the Anbu as Tenzo.\n",
      "After Kakashi Hatake was wounded during his team's mission to rescue Gaara from the Akatsuki, Tsunade places Yamato in Team Kakashi under the cover of acting leader so he can use his Wood Style whenever the need to suppress Kurama's influence over Naruto arises.[ch. 291] For possessing Hashirama's DNA, Yamato gets captured by Kabuto to strengthen the White Zetsu army for the Fourth Great Ninja War. Yamato is eventually revealed to have been contained by the body of the White Zetsu known as Guruguru, until the altered human ejects him once Madara casts the Infinite Tsukiyomi.[ch. 676] In Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring, Yamato is among the ninja assigned to keep tabs on Orochimaru.

Through Obito's scheme, Kurama is released and attacks Konohagakure before being stopped by the Fourth Hokage Minato Namikaze, who seals the fox's Yin half within himself. Following this, Minato and Kushina sacrifice themselves to seal the weakened Yang Kurama within their son, Naruto Uzumaki, twelve years before the series' start.[ch. 1][ch. 500] Throughout the series, Naruto tries to harness Kurama's immense chakra to perform several jutsu that would normally be impossible for a shinobi of his age.[ch. 95] But Naruto soon learns that relying too much on Kurama's power would allow the fox to impose its will over its host to the point of breaking the seal. Naruto eventually takes control of the fox's chakra with help from an imprint of Kushina.[ch. 499] During Naruto's fight against Obito, seeing its host's resolve to save the other Tailed Beasts, Kurama befriends Naruto by allowing him to achieve Tailed Beast Mode.[ch. 571] Eventually, as Kurama is extracted from Naruto, the Tailed Beast tells Gaara how to save Naruto's life by transferring Yin Kurama from Minato into Naruto. Kurama is later returned to its Jinchuriki's body and becomes whole again as it reunites with its Yin counterpart. During the events of Boruto, Kurama convinces Naruto to use Baryon Mode in the fight against Isshiki, which results in Kurama ceasing to exist with Naruto rendered a normal human. Kishimoto was mainly inspired to create Kurama based on the character with the same name from the manga series YuYu Hakusho. The inclusion of the fox spirit was also inspired by Godzilla.\n",

Suigetsu tends to have a sadistic personality, constantly fascinating about cutting things and consequently getting on Karin's nerves, yet sees himself as normal in comparison to most other people.

Because of this, in childhood, Jugo was an outcast, eventually finding solace in Kimimaro whom he saw as an older sibling.[ch. 414] After meeting Sasuke, he tried to refuse being part of Taka and used his abilities, but Sasuke managed to calm him down.

The latter event result in him having the transplanted right eye of Shisui Uchiha, whom he killed, along with having Orochimaru using Shin's genetic makeup to graft Danzo's right arm with a large number of Sharingan eyes and Hashirama's cells. Following Pain's attack devastating Konohagakure, Danzo took advantage of Tsunade's coma in convincing the Fire Country's feudal lord to make him Acting Candidate Sixth Hokage (六代目火影候補, Rokudaime Hokage Kouho) and uses his position to decree Sasuke a wanted criminal before attaining the Five Kage summit to convince the formation of the Shinobi alliance with himself as its leader. But the plan fails as Danzo ends up being fatally wounded after being forced to fight Sasuke, using the last of his strength in an attempted sealing jutsu on his killer and Obito.[ch. 481] Though the jutsu failed, Danzō destroyed Shisui's Sharingan to ensure Tobi would not obtain it.

      "== Reception ==\n",
      "The characters of Naruto have received both praise and criticism from publications dedicated to anime, manga, and other media. Active Anime lauded the characters for not being \"simple cardboard cut-out characters\" due to their \"fleshed out personalities\" and \"underlying dramatic motivations\", and praised the \"deeply moving emotional trials\" they undergo over the course of the series. Adam Cook of Anime Boredom agreed with this assessment, extolling the characters as \"well rounded\" and \"imaginative\", and celebrated how the characters allowed the series to successfully incorporate comedy, action, and drama together in a believable manner. A review from Derrick Tucker, also of THEM Anime Reviews offered a positive view, commenting that Naruto Uzumaki combined the finer values of his shōnen predecessors, but lamented how the characters' personalities tended to fall between Naruto's \"charisma and coolness\" and Sasuke's \"blandness\", making it difficult to think about the characters on \"any deep or meaningful level\". Justin Rich of the entertainment website Mania asserted that the series lacked the \"tremendous depth in it's [sic] characters\" or \"the most flushed out backgrounds\" seen in other shōnen series, and believed the primary strength of the series was the fighting.\n",
      "The visual appearances of the characters in the anime and manga have also received notice from reviewers. Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network praised the characters' \"distinctive clothing, hair, faces and personalities\" that made them easily identifiable, as well as Kishimoto's \"clear eye for geography, movement and the human form\" and \"impeccable visual timing\". Tucker, on the other hand, described Kishimoto as \"an average artist at best\" and derided the poor transition of his artistic style into animation. Despite this, he admitted that when the animators were at their best, they produced \"artistic renderings that leave little to be desired on the part of fans of the manga\", but ultimately concluded the animation was \"a mixed bag\". \n",

His family manages to get the money to pay his bail so Isami's father, Kirakusai, travels alongside his grandson, Tomokichi, to pay Isami's bail. However, on the way to free Isami, Kirakusai is attacked and killed by Master Rokuyaon Gun who kidnaps the two-year-old Tomokichi and abandons him in a valley. During this time, a masterless samurai of the Miyoshi House, Ogata Shuma Hiroyuki, better known as \"Jiraiya\", happens upon the young Tomokichi and decides to raise him as his son.\n",

Gentaro and Master Gun then begin working together to capture Jiraiya as he is a wanted criminal. Fortunately, though caught, Jiraiya manages to scheme his way out of jail. Gentaro eventually meets his wife, Soe (who now goes by \"Seino\") and they discuss the former's hatred for whoever killed his father and son, both unaware the latter is alive. Master Gun eavesdrops on this conversation and decides to steal their Amulet of Protection, also known as the \"Seitensō\" (西天草), and proceeds to kill both Gentaro and Soe. Tomokichi—whilst engaged in a duel with Master Gun for Midori, the stepdaughter of Gentaro—learns that it was he who murdered his family. While this allows Tomokichi a chance to exact his revenge, he is unable to take it as Master Gun uses the Amulet of Protection to escape.\n",
      "Master Gun is chased to Mt. Miyoko by Tomokichi and, upon reaching the mountain, is accosted by the spirits of the dead until he arrives to a grotto where the Immortal Toad Ascetic lives. They converse and the immortal sees all of Master Guns' sins and even tells him that, since there are dead souls haunting him, he must be a murderer and that he'll die from his sins. Terrified, Master Gun begs the immortal to save him, to which he agrees but saying he will only help him once. The immortal then uses his magic arts to send Master Gun down the mountain before warning him if he tells anyone of this encounter he will die. However, later that night, after getting drunk with one of Jiraiya's followers, Master Gun tells him of the events at Mt. Miyoko. The morning after Master Gun leaves, Jiraiya goes to Mt. Miyoko to visit the Immortal. The Toad Ascetic then appears in front of Jiraiya and tells him that, even though he is a bandit who committed innumerable sins, he'll teach him one magic art as he admires Jiraiya's loyalty. While Master Gun and Jiraiya are visiting the immortal, Tomokichi sets out to find them and, upon finally locating Jiraiya, recounts to his stepfather of what has happened to his family. Jiraiya vows to assist Tomokichi in his revenge and will be there to help when he is needed, sending his troops to steal the Seitenso from Master Gun so as to lure him out in order to kill him.\n",

Jiraiya sets off towards the mountain to save his master and, when he arrives, sees a monstrous snake fighting his master, who's taken on the form of a giant toad. Jiraiya manages to kill the snake and is rewarded by the immortal with more magic arts, which he then uses to rob a wealthy man right after learning them. Since Jiraiya is wanted by the government, he became a pirate and started plundering commercial ships, until one night at sea the ghost of his former lord, Miyoshi Nagashige asks him to take revenge on the Ishido family, more specifically Ishido Haruchika. Jiraiya agrees and he soon after saves a vassal of Ishido named Agawa Uneo, and his companion Nagisa, the younger sister of another vassal named Madeno Hamanosuke, to which he tosses Agawa Uneo into the sea and takes Nagisa hostage. Agawa Uneo is then saved by a former member of his group and begins to pursue Jiraiya immediately after recovering. During this time, Madeno Hamanosuke goes to Mt. Kinki to pray to Benzaiten, a god related to snakes, for the safety of his lord. He is answered by a goddess who appears before him and gives him the Stone Conch, otherwise known as the \"Ishihara\" (石螺), which holds the power to negate magic arts and repel evil.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Tomokichi has become a vassal of Shiizu Kunihisa after taking revenge on Master Gun and is ordered to take back the Amulet of Protection from Jiraiya, to which he sets off in search of his adoptive father. After finding Jiraiya, Tomokichi asks him to return the Amulet of Protection to which the former agrees, but only after the next six months as he needs it to complete his revenge. In order to keep this meeting a secret, Jiraiya summons a powerful tsunami to kill all of Tomokichi's troops despite the latter's pleads for mercy to his men. After all is said and done, Jiraiya invites Tomokichi to go with him on his revenge quest so that he would not be punished.\n",
      "Jiraiya then begins his plan, first by robbing betrothal gifts for Ishido Haruchika's daughter, Tamahitohime, which leads to the death of Nagisa. After sneaking into the Nitsuki House, Jiraiya summons a tsunami to kill all of the servants in order for his troops to pose as them and sneak into the Ishido residence. Jiraiya then finds a mountain hermit who was going to treat one of Ishido Haruchika's sick daughters and kills him, he then pretends to be the mountain hermit in order to sneak into the Ishido House. After sneaking into Ishido Haruchikas's room, Jiraiya then cuts off his head.\n",
      "Afterwards, Jiraiya calls on Tomokichi to return the Amulet of Protection as promised. However, Madeno Hamanosuke shows up and announces the head of the man Jiraiya cut off actually belonged to Agawa Uneo and all of his troops were captured because a member of the Jiraiya's group, Asazuma was a vassal of Ishido and warned the Ishido house of his plan. Jiraiya tries to use his magic arts to defeat Madeno Hamanosuke, however, Madeno uses the Stone Conch that was given to him by Benzaiten to negate Jiraiya's magic arts.

      "A popular version of the story was translated by William Elliot Griffis. The story starts with Jiraiya's father, who was a castle lord, but was killed during one of many civil wars. After he is killed, young Jiraiya is hidden by a retainer and is able to escape, but they are attacked by a band of robbers and the retainer is killed after resisting. Jiraiya goes to a place called Echigo where he spent the rest of his childhood. Jiraiya now led a wandering life in several provinces but wished to restore his family name. His swordsmanship talent and exceptional bravery allowed Jiraiya to soon become a chief of his own band of robbers, where he would sneak in disguise to places he robbed in order to learn where the treasure was stored. He would then come back and steal said treasure later.\n",
      "One day, Jiraiya heard of an old man who lived in Shinano and so he started off to rob him. The land was a place full of mountains and was full of snow in the winter. During the journey, he was beset by a great snowstorm and he took refuge in a small house that he happened upon, inside was a beautiful woman who treated him with great kindness. This did not change Jiraiya's nature as a robber though and after midnight he went to kill her with his sword while she was reading. However, in a flash, her body changed to a very old man who grabbed the heavy steel blade and easily broke it into pieces. He then announces his name as Senso Dojin, and that he is a giant frog that has lived on the mountain for hundreds of years. He pardons Jiraiya after telling him he could kill him easily and then teaches him magic arts. Jiraiya stayed with Senso Dojin for several weeks learning the magic arts of the mountain sprites in order to control the weather as well as to control frogs and change their shape and size at will. After Senso teaches him he forbids him from robbing or injuring the poor and helpless and to instead take from those who use and acquire money dishonestly and to help the needy and suffering. He then turns into a giant frog and hops away.\n",
      "After this Jiraiya sets out on his journey to help the poor and needy by helping a poor farmer whose crops failed and he could not pay his rent or loan on time. As well whenever a miser was robbed they would say that the young thunder had struck, as Jiraiya was very popular with the poor people of the time. During this time when Jiraiya was helping the poor and needy, a young maiden named Tsunade also lived in the same province of Kiushiu. She was a model daughter and was always obedient and kind. One day during her trip into the mountains for firewood she met a very old man who approached her and told her he had lived in the mountains for hundreds of years and that his body was really that of a snail. He then offers to teach Tsunade the powers of magic he possesses. She gladly accepted and began training daily with the old man. Once she had mastered the magic, she was advised to use her powers to defend the poor and destroy wicked robbers, and to join her powers with Jiraiya in the form of marriage. The old man then turns into a snail and crawls away. Tsunade then remarks that she and Jiraiya with the combination of slug magic and frog magic would be able to destroy a robber named Orochimaru, who was the son of a serpent. Tsunade and Jiraiya eventually met and were married soon after.\n",
      "Soon after Jiraiya and Tsunade were married war broke out in Japan between the Tsukikage and the Inukage. In the war, the Tsukikage sought out the help of Jiraiya and Tsunade who agreed to help them with the war, while the other clan the Inukage sought the help of Orochimaru otherwise known as Dragon-coil. Orochimaru was known as a very wicked robber whose father was a man and mother was a serpent that lived at the bottom of lake Takura, he was skilled in the magic of the serpent and would spew venom on the strongest of warriors to destroy them.\n",
      "During a respite between the conflicts, Jiraiya and Tsunade were resting in a monastery. In the monastery, there was also a princess named Tagoto that had fled from Orochimaru as he wanted her to be his bride. She hated Orochimaru and did not want to marry him, however, when Orochimaru upon hearing that Tagoto and Jiraiya were in the same monastery, immediately made his way to the monastery. He then kidnapped the princess Tagoto and poured poisonous venom onto the sleeping Jiraiya and Tsunade. After they are poisoned one of Jiraiya's pages, Rikimatsu, volunteers to go to India to retrieve the only antidote to cure Jiraiya and Tsunade.
