Readers pointed out that Pence never explicitly advocated for conversion therapy in his statement and that he may have been pushing for safer sex practices. Pence\\'s words are open to other interpretations: Gay and lesbian leaders, for example, say his statement continues to give the impression that he supported the controversial practice of conversion therapy when his words are viewed in context with his long opposition to LGBT rights. Taking all of this into account, we are changing our rating to Half True and providing this new analysis.', \"PolitiFact California's practice is to consider new evidence and perspectives related to our fact checks, and to revise our ratings when warranted.\", \"California Lt.

During his first successful run for Congress in 2000, Pence wrote on his campaign website, under a section called Strengthening the American Family:\", '\"Congress should support the reauthorization of the Ryan White Care Act only after completion of an audit to ensure that federal dollars were no longer being given to organizations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus. Resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior.\"', 'Many, including Newsom and other LGBT advocates, have interpreted the last portion of Pence\\'s statement, about \"assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior,\" as evidence he supported conversion therapy.', \"The statement, however, does not explicitly mention conversion therapy. And Pence has said little, if anything, specific on the topic. We heard from a number of readers who said Pence's words could be interpreted as supporting groups that aim to not necessarily change one's sexual orientation, but instead as supporting groups that advocate for curbing sexual behaviors that lead to the spread of HIV/AIDS. Pence has, for example, advocated for abstinence as a way to prevent sexual diseases.\", '\"Indeed, promoting safer sexual behaviour is a common intervention strategy in the fight against HIV/AIDS,\" reader Justin Goddard of Ontario, Canada, said in an email.', \"Other fact-checking websites, such as Snopes.com, have examined the claim Pence supported conversion therapy and concluded it's not a settled case.\", \"LGBT rights advocates say given Pence's extensive record of opposing gays and lesbians, his words are indeed confirmation that he supported conversion therapy.\", '\"That is very specific language some might call it a dog whistle that has been used for decades to very thinly cloak deeply homophobic beliefs,\" Rea Carey, executive director of the National L.G.B.T.Q. Task Force told the New York Times in late November. \"Particularly the phrase seeking to change their sexual behavior,\\' to me, is code for conversion therapy.\"', '\"It\\'s the most likely reading\" of Pence\\'s words, Rick Zbur, executive director of Equality California, an LGBT civil rights group, told PolitiFact California. \"We view this in the context of the whole record. You can\\'t think of someone who is more hostile to LGBT people and people with AIDS than Mike Pence.\"', 'Also on the 2000 website, Pence wrote: \"Congress should oppose any effort to put gay and lesbian relationships on an equal legal status with heterosexual marriage.\" And \"Congress should oppose any effort to recognize homosexual\\'s [sic] as a \\'discreet [sic] and insular minority\\' entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities.\"', 'Statement mischaracterized?', \"In an email exchange with PolitiFact California in late July, Pence's spokesman Marc Lotter did not directly answer whether Pence supported conversion therapy.\", 'Four months later, Lotter told the New York Times, however, that it was \"patently false\" that Mr. Pence \"supported or advocated\" the practice of conversion therapy.', 'Lotter added that Pence had been calling for federal funds to \"be directed to groups that promoted safe sexual practices\" during his 2000 congressional campaign, and he said it was a \"mischaracterization\" to interpret the statement as a reference to conversion therapy.', \"Newsom's campaign spokesman said in November he did not have any additional information pointing to Pence's stance on conversion therapy.\", 'As reported by McClatchy DC in July, Pence continues to be at the center of gay rights controversy: \"Pence angered gay rights groups (in 2015) when he signed a religious freedom bill that opponents said would allow businesses to discriminate against customers based on their sexual orientation.

Jerry Brown recently jabbed at former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, saying Golden State is \"growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas.\"', 'Brown made this claim in the middle of an impassioned defense of climate change science at the American Geophysical Union conference on Dec. 14, 2016 in San Francisco.', '\"We\\'ve proved in California that the economy grows. And it grows in part because of the climate rules that we\\'ve adopted,\" Brown said.', 'Perry, a climate change skeptic, was recently selected U.S. energy secretary by President-elect Trump. While Texas governor, he repeatedly visited California in an attempt to lure jobs to the Lone Star State, with the promise of less regulation and lower costs.', \"In his speech, Brown said Perry's critiques about California's job-killing red tape don't hold up.\", '\"Now remember our new secretary of energy, he was coming to California to say: Come to Texas because we have all the jobs in Texas.\"', '\"Well, Rick: I got some news for you, California is growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas, and we have more sun than you have oil!\"', '', 'Gov. Jerry Brown makes his claim about California \"growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas\" at about the 13:00 minute mark in the video above.', 'With Brown\\'s reference of Perry, we took his \"faster than Texas\" claim to mean faster economic growth with a focus on jobs. We decided to zero-in on job growth rates in California and Texas, while also weighing GDP and unemployment trends in the states.', \"We'll leave the fun comparison of sunshine to oil for Brown and Perry to wrestle with another day.\", 'Our research', 'We concede there\\'s no definition for what \"a hell of a lot faster\" growth looks like. Still, we\\'ll do our best to sort out the governor\\'s claim.', \"Brown's spokeswoman pointed us to several news articles detailing California's recent economic improvements.\", \"Looking solely at 2015 job growth rates, Brown's claim appears to hold up.\", \"In that year, California added 483,000 jobs, posting a jobs growth rate of 3 percent, based on data we crunched from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That pace was twice as fast as Texas' 1.5 percent job growth rate.\", 'California\\'s rapid employment gains have slowed somewhat to about 2 percent this year through November. That may not qualify as \"a hell of a lot faster,\" but it\\'s still greater than Texas\\' roughly 1.6 percent job growth rate so far this year.', 'The business website Kiplinger.com forecast California would rank 10th in the nation among states for fastest job growth in 2016. It noted that Texas was not on its Top 10 list.', \"It wasn't long ago, however, that Texas outpaced California.\", \"In 2014, Texas recorded a 3.7 percent job growth rate, ahead of California's 2.9 percent pace.\", \"Looking to the future, California's job gains may slow. The closely watched UCLA Anderson Forecast predicts jobs to grow by only 1.5 percent in the state during 2017 and just 0.8 percent in 2018.\", 'Because Brown used the phrase \"is growing,\" we\\'ll judge him on the most recent figures, not future forecasts.', 'Overall economy', \"While the pace of job growth is important, it's not the only measurement of a state's economic health. And Brown's claim could be interpreted as California's overall economy, not just jobs, is growing much faster than the economy in Texas.\", 'In August, PolitiFact Texas took a deep look at the economies of both California and Texas to evaluate a June claim by Juli n Castro, the U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development, that \"Today, California is kicking our butt, creating more jobs and more economic growth than Texas.\"', 'It rated the claim True, citing greater jobs, per capita income and GDP growth rates in California. It noted Texas had a lower jobless rate.', 'Building on that fact check, we looked at the most recent economic figures for both states to see if the assessment still holds.', \"We found that California's GDP grew faster than Texas' in the first two quarters of this year, at rates of 2 percent and most recently 2.2 percent compared with Texas' 1.3 percent and its most recent quarter, a negative 0.8 percent, according to a news release in December by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\", \"It was a different story in 2015 when Texas' GDP expanded by 4.8 percent (a figure that was recently revised upward) compared with California's 3.8 percent GDP expansion.\", 'Comparing unemployment rates, Texas, at 4.6 percent in November, has consistently fared better than California, where the rate was 5.3 percent in November, and has hovered well above 5 percent this year.', 'California had one more economic bright spot in 2015: Per capita personal income grew at twice the rate as in Texas, 5.4 percent to 2.6 percent, according to federal data.', 'Our ruling', 'Gov. Jerry Brown recently claimed \"California is growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas.\"', \"We took this to mean economic growth with a focus on the pace of job creation. California's 3 percent job growth rate in 2015, which doubled Texas' pace, definitely fits into Brown's colorful claim.\", \"But California's rate has slowed to about 2 percent so far this year, closer to Texas' 1.6 job growth rate.\", \"Other economic metrics show California faring better than Texas in several, though not all, categories: California's GDP expanded faster than Texas' GDP in the first two quarters of this year, though Texas had a faster GDP growth rate in 2015. Also, per capita income grew twice as fast in California as Texas in 2015, also backing Brown's statement.\", 'Texas, however, has consistently held a lower jobless rate than California in recent years.', 'Brown, like the state\\'s economy in recent years, is on the right track. And while California has expanded jobs and its economy faster than Texas in many cases, there are a few cases where that growth has been strong but not necessarily \"a hell of a lot faster.\"', \"We rate Brown's statement Mostly True.\", 'MOSTLY TRUE The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.', 'https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/158c502a-4b3e-463d-906f-529da13e2451'], 'claim': '\"California is growing a hell of a lot faster than Texas.\"', 'headerImage': [['https://static.politifact.com/politifact/mugs/jerry-brown_3.jpg', 'Politifact_images/659.png', '']], 'headerTitle': \"Is California's economy 'growing a hell of a lot faster' than Texas?\", 'publish_date': '', 'rating': [['https://static.politifact.com/rulings/tom-mostlytrue.png', 'Politifact_images/476.png', \"POLITIF TRUTH-O - TER'M\"]]}\n"

      "{'body-image': [], 'body-text': ['Whether modern depictions of the appearance of Jesus are historically accurate has long been a subject of debate, and one rumor related to that debate holds that the modern image of Jesus is largely based on the appearance of Cesare Borgia, a 15th century Italian nobleman.', 'Claims about Cesare Borgia\\'s likeness forming the basis for all modern depictions of Jesus are scattered. An online \"encyclopedia\" of dubious merit asserts the rumor as a \"little known fact,\" crediting French novelist Alexandre Dumas for the notion that Borgia \"influenced many images of Jesus Christ painted during and subsequent to his career.\"', 'Dumas was, while celebrated, a writer of fiction and not an historian. The rumor is frequently attributed to \"Volume I\" of Dumas\\' Celebrated Crimes (The Borgias), but we were unable to locate an expression of it in that essay.', 'Myriad online image macros assert that Borgia\\'s father \"forced\" his son\\'s visage into art history (a claim offered as an irony given that the Borgia family were supposedly \"not Christ-like\"), but no evidence ever accompanies such assertions:', 'Such images imply that the relatively standardized, modern depiction of Jesus emerged in approximately 1490, but art historians might argue otherwise. Although the Renaissance produced a vast quantity of the most prominent depictions of Jesus, plenty of artworks antedating 1490 bear the same visual qualities that were purportedly based on those of Borgia:', \"The need for representations of Christ's life in Italy was based on official practice within the Western Church. From the time of Pope Gregory the Great, images were valued both as lessons for the unlettered and as aids to worship. Scenes from Christ's life were thus desirable in churches, on frescoed walls and painted altarpieces, and also in portable form, in illustrated books and small altarpieces suitable for private consumption. Images were meant to enhance the experience of the faithful both in communal and in individual worship, and devotional treatises gave instructions for how to use pictures to enter more fully into sacred history. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, such pictures often occurred in series that allowed viewers to trace the progression of events, but the stories of Christ's life were also represented in independent easel paintings, especially in the sixteenth century and after.\", \"Contrary to claims that Jesus' now-common characteristics emerged in 1490, artworks from the Middle Ages and Early Renaissance depicted Jesus in very much the same way that later artworks did. Giotto di Bondone's well-known 1305 mural The Lamentation of Christ features a white man with long brown hair, and Sandro Botticelli's 1487 Madonna of the Pomegranate depicts a similarly featured infant Christ. Hieronymus Bosch's Ecce Homo also antedates 1490 but demonstrates a recognizably familiar Jesus, as does Duccio di Buoninsegna's early 1300's Christ's Farewell to his Apostles (and other works) and Bondone's contemporaneous Last Supper (a very commonly depicted scene across time).\", 'The similarities in Jesus\\' image extend to other regions and movements, with Flemish Renaissance depictions antedating 1490 but still fitting the common pattern. A long haired, pale-skinned Jesus was observed in artworks from 1250 and centuries prior. Clearly, 1490 was in no way the year, or even the millennium, in which the most common characteristics of Jesus\\' depiction in art were solidified. Moreover, limitations in the transmission of ideas and trends in that era was such that;the establishment of a \"new Jesus\" would have taken years to propagate across countries and cultures in Europe.', '', 'Many image macros assert that Cesare Borgia was the son of a corrupt gangster, a criminal, a dictator, and a sexual deviant. Although Borgia is historically established as one of the likely illegitimate children of Pope Alexander VI (born Rodrigo Borgia), reference works describe the elder Borgia as a controversial Pope but not a \"gangster.\" It\\'s widely held that Pope Alexander VI\\'s checkered reign led in part to the backlash heralding the Protestant Reformation, but historical literature doesn\\'t describe him as a \"dictator.\" As for Cesare Borgia himself, he was born in 1476 and died at the age of 31 in 1507, so had his image been used as the model for Jesus in artworks created in or before 1490, those works would have been based on the features of a young teenager.', 'Cesare Borgia of course lived centuries before the advent of cameras, so the most common image we have of Borgia now is a portrait of disputed provenance:', 'The scant record includes another portrait which bears no noteworthy resemblance to either contemporaneous 15th century or modern depictions of Jesus:', '', \"In 2001 forensic anthropologist Richard Neave created a model of a Galilean man for a BBC documentary, Son of God, working on the basis of an actual skull found in the region. Neave did not claim his model showed Jesus's face but rather offered it as a means of prompting people to consider a Jesus who looked like a man of his time and place, since the Bible does not describe Jesus as having distinctive features:\", 'Much like conspiracy theories based primarily on modern photographs, the claim that depictions of Jesus originated with a portrait of Borgia appear to hinge almost entirely on negligible visual similarities in multiple artworks and the efficacy of suggestion.', 'No specific painting is routinely cited as one for which Cesare Borgia purportedly sat as a model (or which he inspired), and oddly enough, the image most commonly associated with this rumor was painted in 1940 and bears no resemblance to the few extant Borgia portraits.', 'The claim about Borgia and Jesus is possibly a distant variant of old and long-circulating rumors that Renaissance artist Michaelangelo Buonarroti\\'s famed Sistine Chapel ceiling contains \"Easter eggs\" evidencing covert motives or illustrating grudges on the artist\\'s part.', '1995 - 2019 by Snopes Media Group Inc.', 'This material may not be reproduced without permission.', 'Snopes and the Snopes.com logo are registered service marks of Snopes.com'], 'claim': \"The modern image of Jesus is modeled on Cesare Borgia, a gangster's son.

A laccolith is a large, mushroom shaped mass of igneous rock which intrudes between the layers of sedimentary rocks but does not reach the surface. This produces a rounded bulge in the sedimentary layers above the intrusion. This idea was quite popular in the early 1900s when numerous studies were done on a number of laccoliths in the Southwest.\", 'Other ideas have suggested that Devils Tower is a volcanic plug or that it is the neck of an extinct volcano. Although there is no evidence of volcanic activity volcanic ash, lava flows, or volcanic debris anywhere in the surrounding countryside, it is possible that this material may simply have eroded away.', 'The simplest explanation is that Devils Tower is a stock a small intrusive body formed by magma which cooled underground and was later exposed by erosion.', '<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-98819\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" src=\"https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/ThreeGeoTheoriessm_1.jpg?w=600\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/ThreeGeoTheoriessm_1.jpg?w=640 640w, https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/ThreeGeoTheoriessm_1.jpg?resize=300,69 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\">', 'Wyoming State Parks also addressed the claim in a 1 August 2017 Facebook post:', \"Wyoming State Parks did not, does not, has not and will not be participating in any kind of scientific study as claimed by this website, which is a fake account and has no basis in reality.
